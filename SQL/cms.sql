(3, 'A Q&amp;A with Steve Trapps', 0, '', '', 'crop_5238652a386584e5a3b129935b5b406a.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi Steve, thanks for taking the time to talk to us today. We can see &nbsp;you&#039;ve had an impressive career in IT so far. &nbsp;What prompted / &nbsp;encouraged you to pursue a career in technology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;That&#039;s no problem. Well I was 8 years old when the first personal &nbsp;computers became readily available i.e. ZX81, Commodore Vic 20. &nbsp;Building on messing around on these, when I had to make a career &nbsp;choice computing seemed like a safe bet. Growing up in the North in the &nbsp;80&rsquo;s, I also remember someone saying that you&rsquo;ll always have a job if &nbsp;you know how to use a computer.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI enjoyed creating programs and there used to be magazines that contained code listings that you could type in to the computer and then play the games. I guess that&rsquo;s where my skills in debugging programs started, as I&rsquo;m sure the magazine publishers would put mistakes in on purpose so that you&rsquo;d have to buy the next month&rsquo;s magazine with the corrections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom an academic point of view, I remember one Teacher at Park Lane College in Leeds who, when doing my BTEC, encouraged and inspired me not to give up when the program just wouldn&rsquo;t work as expected.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;In your most recent positions your roles have been working as a Scrum Master. We often see lots of debate online about what the role of a Scrum Master is. How would you define / describe the role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;On a day to day basis, it is to ensure that the Scrum ceremonies are adhered to by the team and to ensure that distractions are kept away from the team. So my role almost like a Team Bouncer and a Fixer, i.e. making problems go away!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAt its heart, the role is to ensure that team has every chance of hitting the commitment it made at the start of the sprint.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA Scrum Master isn&rsquo;t a team leader, or Project Manager, as they&rsquo;re there to help coach the team to always try to do the best thing for the situation. By having that person supporting the team and not dictating the solution the Scrum Master should have a good view of the situation and be able to advise accordingly.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What aspects of your role do you enjoy most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Helping the team to become better and learn how to do things better. Talking to people and trying to understand what their issues are and by working together, how the team can deliver what they need.&nbsp;Being able to coach and motivate a team to look at the situations and see how to improve. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are the day to day challenges you face in your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;People assuming that you&rsquo;re a Team Leader. Although this is something that I can do, my role as Scrum Master is to support the team - not to dictate to them. The goals we should be working towards are self - organised and self-motivated teams. Without that you can put in as much framework as you want but ultimately the team will fail as they won&rsquo;t be exhibiting agile qualities. They&rsquo;ll just be going through the motions. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOther People Misunderstanding &amp; Interpretation of Agile frameworks.&nbsp;Scrum is a framework and what works for one company may not necessarily work for another. The secret is to work out what works for that company.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPeople often think that using Agile methodologies means you can cut corners and I&rsquo;m often quoted &ldquo;You&rsquo;re agile, you can do this&rdquo; just to get things done. The use of Agile is being quoted against you just because you&rsquo;re trying to do the right thing. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Agile has now been around 15+ years. Do you think it&rsquo;s reached its maturity, or will we see it continue to grow and develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I say that the Agile process is like evolution. We may see less innovation but it will continue to grow and develop. We&rsquo;ll see teams attempt new practices and the ones that are successful will continue to exist and force more changes as others try to catch up.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHopefully in the future, there won&rsquo;t be an &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; way. It will be the only way. After all we&rsquo;re just making sure that people and teams talk to each other on a regular basis. That&rsquo;s the beauty of working in an Agile framework &ndash; you can&rsquo;t hide anymore. Long gone are they days of a 6 month project where nobody knew what they were getting until the very end of the project. We talk regularly and often.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is still the need and projects where traditional methodologies work better than agile. Its just that agile is now seen as an equal approach to use &ndash; not just in small teams in &ldquo;digital&rdquo; projects. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are the developing areas of Agile? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s next for Agile?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I was going to say more mainstream acceptance. However that&rsquo;s already happening. Large governmental institutions have adopted using agile. The next thing for Agile is its adoption into other areas of business.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the rise of DevOps adoption we&rsquo;re seeing new approaches being pushed into the full product lifecycle. Success in these areas, as we become quicker to deliver what people want, will force the areas that they touch - marketing, sales etc. to adopt techniques used within IT. For once, the bottleneck will be other departments and not anymore the IT department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Let&rsquo;s rewind a little bit, tell us about your early technical career as a Developer. &nbsp;What tech did you start out using?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;From a professional point of view I started out using&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://delphi-tech.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delphi&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/PowerBuilder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Powerbuilder&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barclays.co.uk/PersonalBanking/P1242557947640&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nestle.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nestle&lt;/a&gt;. At Nestle I moved into the Microsoft world when learning Classic ASP (i.e. pre .Net). Prior to that though, I&rsquo;d previously seen Visual Basic 4 (VB4) whilst on placement at Proctor &amp; Gamble in my degree course. It was like a different world to what I&rsquo;d seen before.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBeing able to use the IDE to create buttons on forms was major thing for me. I remember seeing VB4 for the first time and being blown away with the ease that things could be done. I was basing my knowledge at the time on things I&rsquo;d seen done in Pascal and Cobol and wondered &ldquo;What witchcraft was I seeing &ndash; how long does it take a developer to create each button? They must work out the coordinates for each of the corners and somehow plot them on the screen.&rdquo; But no, it was drag and drop buttons in VB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;ve predominantly worked with Microsoft technology &ndash; what are your thoughts on the latest Microsoft technology (e.g. &nbsp;Azure, C#8)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is an amazing offering from Microsoft. As a developer I always worry what kit will I get and will it cope with the load when deploying into an environment. &nbsp;Azure has taken that worry away from me, as it&rsquo;s the same standard infrastructure and if something becomes more popular than first thought &ndash; no worries, just add in a new server and remove it when you don&rsquo;t need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It&rsquo;s has opened new doors for me. Technologies that I&rsquo;d be wary of utilising or are cumbersome to setup are readily available.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;-&ldquo;Want to stick a new caching layer in to your app? &nbsp;No problem, implement Redis and it is there&rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n-&ldquo;Want to see how easy MongoDB is to use &ndash; fire one up from the Azure Marketplace and have a play with it&rdquo;.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n-&ldquo;How does a CDN change your applications responsiveness? &ndash; No worries, just wire in one and see what happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It has brought a new world to my fingertips where I can compete with large companies by having the ability to call on the scale of Microsoft. Obviously you have to pay for the privilege but compare with going out and buying the physical equipment and software &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t compare!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to go Open Source &ndash; the right move or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Yes, definitely. It opens up more possibilities and greater collaboration for the products that they&rsquo;re creating.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe community was looking for alternatives. Feeling empowered by this and being able to build the tools that they needed to deliver the products that they wanted, Microsoft had to do something just to keep up. They were in danger of become, in the future, a niche player in the development world.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe community has embraced the move and so you&rsquo;re seeing people like&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mat_mcloughlin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mat Mcloughlin&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and the work he is doing with others on&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnisharp.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OmiSharp&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;creating new and exciting possibilities.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;The rise of technology continues to make undeniable differences to our lives. How has technology changed the way you do your job now in comparison to when you first started out?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Being able to work from home, when needed. The work life balance is important to us all. If we&rsquo;re going to keep motivated individuals in the industry, having the ability to connect to all the areas I would be able to if I was in the office is vital. Happy colleagues make for motivated colleagues.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe ease of seeing and talk to colleagues in other countries, via Skype and other applications is great. At one time I was doing stand-ups with colleagues in Amsterdam, people working at home in the UK and with people in the office. We felt like a united team but were in 3 different places.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is a word of caution here, that too much technology in our lives can be detrimental. Always being contactable isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good thing. We should limit ourselves to its use especially at weekends and holidays. If we don&rsquo;t limit its access we may need to learn new behaviours and habits - otherwise we&rsquo;ll always be working and never resting.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What advancements in the technology sector excite you the most at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Slightly out of my area, however what&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;are doing is amazing. &nbsp;Building on the success of their more expense model which is really only available to the super rich, Tesla are enabling people to buy electric cars for &pound;25K. It&rsquo;s still more than I would want to spend on a car, but it makes the technology more affordable and hopefully sees the adoption of electric cars into the mainstream.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2016 is already set to bring some new and interesting digital trends and gadgets. Which trend/ gadget are you most looking forward to hearing more about/ trying out this year and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;For someone who works in technology, I&rsquo;m actually not that interested in gadgets. I keep a watchful eye on things but tend wait until things have become more mainstream. I still buy my music on CDs!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nConnect with Steve&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevetrapps?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=IvQQ&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CentityType%3AentityHistoryName%2CclickedEntityId%3Amynetwork_4736007%2Cidx%3A0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-steve-trapps', 'yes', 'yes', 1460073600),
(4, 'A Q&amp;A with EdTech Entrepreneur Chloe Barrett', 2, '', '', '51fd3bddc174a021fa19f96cdeeb18c6.png', '&lt;h2&gt;In this Q&amp;A we hear from Ed Tech entrepreneur&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-barrett-957453a1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chloe Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Digi Dentistry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDigiDentistry provides an advanced way of learning using augmented reality and animation, targeting all learning domains, offering a multi-language system and an intelligent E-learning platform. Enhancing and changing dental education for the better.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nChloe&rsquo;s inspiring work at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digidentistry.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DigiDentistry&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;found her winning this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Young Entrepreneur of The Year&rsquo; Enterprise Visionary Awards. Chloe is also a finalist at the Digital Entrepreneur Awards, UK Tech Founder Awards, Great British Entrepreneur and UK Business Tech Awards.&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;In this Q&amp;A she tells us about her career path so far, plans for the future, her time in Silicon Valley and more...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us more about DigiDentistry - what it is, and who it is aimed at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DigiDentistry is bridging the gap between theory and practical learning, using technology as an enabler to improve education specifically aimed at academic areas requiring interactive content.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe concept of allowing this application to target all learning domains came from my own experience as a visual learner and a lecturer trying to accommodate all students learning styles in the classroom and develop homework resources which would be suitable for all students. In creating DigiDentistry I wanted to make a real difference in education.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDigiDentistry is currently aimed at Undergraduate Dental students, Dental Hygienists, Dental Therapists, Dental Nurses and Technicians. We continue to build our content to suit different levels of dental education and post graduate courses.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe have some exiting plans in the pipeline, expanding into other academic areas on an international platform but at currently we want to establish ourselves in the dental market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How did the idea come to life?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I previously set up a dental education company realising the cost and time it was taking to develop resources. I came across augmented reality about 5 years ago, this was the moment I knew I needed to develop something using this technology. I visualised an interactive application displaying 3D images for example tooth procedures, rare diseases, from here it has evolved into much more.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What sparked your interest in the EdTech sector?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education has always interested me. I love learning but like the other 75% of the population I am a visual learner, I learn better interacting with the subject. Technology is incredible, it streamlines processes, making tasks easier and reduces the time we spend on time consuming tasks. Technology must be included in education, we need to embrace the technology movement and utilise it. EdTech is growing at 17% every year it an exiting time to be part of this transition.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Do you feel you have had to overcome any particular barriers as a female leader in tech? If so, how did you deal with these?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, undoubtedly there are barriers, I feel I have worked hard to build sustainable relationships.&nbsp; I do feel at times I have had to prove myself more than many male founders I know, especially going through the fundraising process. Of course, I am outnumbered by men at most, if not all, tech events but in a way,&nbsp; I h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ave used this to my advantage, I think at least I stand out as a women in tech.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI hope to Inspire more women and encourage them to explore the world of technology and take on any challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;You spent some time in Silicon Valley, the tech capital of the world! How was that experience and what did you learn?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experience was incredible, I met some amazing people including other founders, mentors, advisors and investors. I learnt something from all of them. I learnt so much, but one thing that sticks in my mind is ensuring my business is not just working from a realistic plan alone. I allow for radical planning this means I always think big. No matter how crazy it sounds, if I visualise it, I will work to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEveryone I met has seen thousands of start-ups, so to be part of network who truly believe my company can go all the way is a feeling of accomplishment. Before I have even hit my peak, reflecting on this gives me confidence in the tough times.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;You recently were the winner of this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Young entrepreneur of the year&rsquo; award. Congratulations! What would your advice be to other young entrepreneurs who are trying to push their venture further?&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you, yes it really helped me reflect on how much I have done this year, being shortlisted and winning these awards makes you sit back and appreciate the hard work. This doesn&rsquo;t happen often; the entrepreneurial journey is a rollercoaster it&rsquo;s not easy to stop and take a moment to say well done to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe advice I would give is keep going, we only know our true strength during the tough times, starting a venture is not for everyone, it takes strength and resilience. Plan milestones and work hard to achieve them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What would you say are the biggest challenges facing growing start-ups at the moment?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&rsquo;s always challenges facing start-ups but a&nbsp; few I would include are access to funding, finding the right investors to support the growth and expertise. I think more transparency is needed in the funding process to ensure time is not wasted. We are all on our own ventures, not everyone will be aligned to join your journey but when you find the right people it starts to fit together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What has been the highlight of your journey with DigiDentistry so far?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There has been several highlights this year, I think the overall positive response we have received from people about what we are working to achieve with EdTech has been a major highlight and confirmation. Being accepted onto a Silicon Valley Accelerator and being given opportunities to speak at amazing events in a variety of different countries, this has given me great insights into different technologies and I have been able to meet some inspiring people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtWoLDEKyXo&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Manchester is making a name for itself worldwide when it comes to its digital activity. What do you like most about being based in Manchester?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the collection of visionaries we have in Manchester, people genuinely want to help each other I feel like I an external team at times, we connect and work together for the better good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What can we expect to see from DigiDentistry in 2019?&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 will be an exiting year for DigiDentistry, we are expanding the team, continuing to evolve our developments. I am really exited to show our new application features. We plan to continue to test our beta phase application in Europe and the US covering additional countries to really streamline our international expansion plans.

discipline dominated by men. &nbsp;The people I spoke to at the fair demonstrated much more desire for careers in the creative / UX space &ndash; technologies such as Javascript, CSS and HTML were much more prevalent than traditional Java / .Net skills. &nbsp;Also, the majority of people I spoke to in this space were young women which I feel is a positive move for the industry as a whole.&rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot;

font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;. &nbsp;Clem delivered a talk all about DevOps culture, and the &lsquo;elephant&rsquo; in the room when it comes to DevOps and common preconceptions. &nbsp;Chris presented an interesting talk all about containerisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chris discussed the adoption of a container strategy, where to start, the gotchas to avoid and the benefits it can bring. &nbsp;Chris used real life-examples from his experience at Rancher working with large and small, public and private sector organisations to develop and implement container strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chris received a series of interesting questions after the presentation that included &ldquo;What is the difference between virtualisation and containers?&rdquo; And &ldquo;If containers share an operating system how secure are they?&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris provided the room with unbiased answers showing the pros and cons of adopting a container strategy. &nbsp;Notably Chris did inform the room that as container technology stands, having a full containerised environment is probably not advisable for various reasons including security and struggles with databases, but if implemented to the correct parts of the environment it can have massive benefits including the ability to run containers on any computer, on any infrastructure and in any cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot;

teams and those who are at the beginning of the journey. &nbsp;Some of the main topics discussed in the Q&amp;A included on &ldquo;How to get buy-in from Executive team / board?&rdquo; &nbsp;and &ldquo;Ability of existing team to upskill &amp; how to do this?&rdquo; &nbsp;As with most of these style of questions Clem revealed that the process of implementing DevOps is different for every organisation and there is no magic formula, however if done correctly it can provide many benefits including a shorter development life cycle and greater stability and reliability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot;

During this time we realised how far behind the sport sector was in terms of the use of technology. Many event organisers and governing bodies were reliant on aging or disparate IT systems, and in some cases were still working from complex spreadsheets or paper-based systems. One of the major contributing factors to this problem was that there was a complete lack of technology that specifically catered for the operational or business management side of sport. So we incorporated Sport:80 and started work on our platform.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Who is Sport:80 aimed at?

It&rsquo;s typically adopted by an International Federation, National Governing Body or Sports Club who use it to manage key areas of their organisations. Uniquely, the Platform can also be made available to participants &ndash; athletes, coaches, officials etc. &ndash; who can manage their personal involvement in the sport, such as purchasing their membership, entering competitions and managing their qualifications for example. We built the technology with this specific aim in mind; it was important that it could be used at every level to provide the governing body with an entire overview of their sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being a growing start-up, what challenges have you encountered so far and how have you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;I think our biggest challenge has been around behavioural change. The reality is that people fear change and because our technology has an impact on so many areas of a sports organisation, these feelings are often amplified when we get in to the detail of a project. Quite early on in our journey we had to come up with a way to quell our client&rsquo;s fears and give them confidence in our technology and our people. This has actually resulted in what is arguably the most valuable element of our business model; our partnership approach. We invest a lot of time in establishing strong working relationships with all of our clients and we take the time to carefully guide them through every stage of a project. Once the Platform is live and in operation, we provide on-going support and a personal level of service that most organisations are not used to receiving when it comes to their technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You were winners at the&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-stars/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;grand final!

There&rsquo;s no way we would have received the level of support that we did from the outset if we didn&rsquo;t have this clear vision and obvious passion for what we were doing. Some of our earliest supporters made it clear that this solidified their belief in us and our ability to achieve what we promised.

It is easy to get distracted by opportunity that sits outside of your natural product suite or development plan. Assess opportunity carefully and be brave enough to turn away offers that may hamper your ability to be the best at what you do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sport:80 is based in Sheffield.

Soon we will be announcing a significant partnership with one of the sport industry&rsquo;s biggest influencers, as well as a number of other partnerships and projects that we are very proud of. There will also be more to come from our work in the United States where we have established some great foundations.

I&rsquo;m not from a very technological family at all&mdash;the opposite, in fact! I didn&rsquo;t get internet access at home until I was 15 (2005) and my family all shared the one computer. I started off wanting to be a graphic designer and spent a lot of the time from 15 to 16, along with my then-best friend, Sam, working on logos and flyers and business cards for local businesses. After a good run at that, I decided that we needed a portfolio site to showcase our skills (we had no skills&mdash;looking back on it, the work was pretty weak), and volunteered myself to learn how to write HTML and CSS to build it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not long after starting that, I realised that not only did I much prefer coding, I was much, much better at it. A series of self-initiated projects later, and I was pretty convinced that this was what I wanted to do full-time. At 17, I began applying for front-end development jobs in Leeds and was picked up by&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyjacobsleeds/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Jacobs, the Creative Director&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;at now-defunct Sense Internet.

My background is in large-scale product environments&mdash;I spent around three years as a Senior Developer at Sky, in Leeds&mdash;so I have a skill-set that these companies value. I guess I&rsquo;m just a little more naturally inclined to that kind of environment.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nAlso, the problems that these companies face&mdash;famous or otherwise&mdash;present a fascinating challenge for me. The proposition, the pressure, and the obstacles posed are a great chance to tackle something new.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nFinally, I guess that if you&rsquo;re working for a well-known company, your work is likely to impact a far higher number of people. It&rsquo;s quite cool to see an advert for Trainline and knowing that I was the person responsible for making that site faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&rsquo;re a Google Developer Expert.

If you&rsquo;re a great advocate and work hard to share knowledge in your field (mine is Technology, but the others are Marketing and Product Design), then a Google employee can invite you onto the program. Once they have made the invite, you then have to go through an interview process; first with an external Expert from the relevant area, and later an interview with a member Google staff.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nIf you pass those, then you&rsquo;re in!

There are lots and lots of new, shiny, exciting tools available, and more and more are appearing each week. While this does add an element of excitement, it also brings a lot a lot of fickleness, and what I see more and more is an entire generation of developers who&rsquo;re focusing on tools but neglecting the basics. Tooling, languages, and frameworks can be learned relatively quickly, but the fundamentals will never change; optimise for a stable baseline of understanding and then complement that with the specifics as and when you need them. That&rsquo;s a recipe for a much more robust and long-lasting career in tech, in my opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;SandboxRoot env-bp-350&quot;

How important do you think it is for technology professionals these days to be active on social media and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;For me it&rsquo;s vital&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great form of direct marketing, meaning I can get my message directly in front of those most likely to hire me. It&rsquo;s an essential business tool. I think that a decent command of social media is going to be crucial for anyone wanting to make their way in tech; the social proof alone helps to build trust and credibility. Though not a deal-breaker, I&rsquo;d be hesitant to hire someone for a tech role if they don&rsquo;t show at least some engagement with the tech community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your focus has mainly been on CSS over the years, but recently your focus has slightly shifted, can you tell us more about this, please?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;CSS is a creative, fun, yet very imperfect language. It grants a lot of creative freedom but also is hard to tame at scale. It&rsquo;s this very fact that allowed me to specialise so heavily in CSS&mdash;I worked on defining and pioneering a lot of the approaches that people across the world use to manage CSS in large applications today. After doing that so intently for so long, I just got ready for a bit of change.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nToward the beginning of 2017, I decided to shift my focus more toward performance engineering&mdash;making websites fast! Performance work is something I&rsquo;ve been involved in for the last five years and was always a vital addition to the front-end development work I&rsquo;d been doing, but I want to make it much more front-and-centre. It&rsquo;s work I find fascinating, rewarding, and newly challenging: you can always produce a faster website; the question is how?&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s also a great way to add lots of value and make plenty of positive impact. Fast websites keep users happier, and they cost companies less to run; they cost users less to visit, and they also earn companies much more money. It&rsquo;s a scenario in which everybody wins.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nA large sub-focus of this has been on the ethical and moral aspects of performance: users in poor-connectivity areas, or regions where data is costly, will genuinely struggle to visit a poorly optimised website. I want to focus on making the same information as accessible to those in rural India as it is in the centre of Leeds.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n(Fun fact: my website takes 1.3 seconds to load from Dublin. In Nepal, it takes closer to a minute. The same site is over 45&times; slower just because of the fact someone is based in a low-connectivity region.)&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You have been based in Leeds for over nine years now!

(11, 'How to Attract and Retain Tech Talent', 0, '', '', '5a882d441ee65a0387a98f2092fcc4d1.png', '&lt;h1&gt;In this post we discuss the importance of attracting and retaining tech talent in a candidate-driven market.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Candidates in the technology market at the moment are spoilt for choice with the sheer number of great companies looking to hire quality digital talent&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s no secret that adopting a solid digital strategy and expanding through various technological channels is pretty high on the list of priorities for the majority of businesses. Therefore, ensuring they have the right employees with the relevant digital skills is becoming extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where talent pools across many industries are extremely competitive between candidates, with candidates having to tackle thousands of other applicants to fight for one role, it would seem that this is slightly different in technology. The&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/investment-in-digital-skills-still-low-69211124481&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;digital skills gap&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;has been a hot topic in the industry for a while now - the roles are there, but the top talent to fill the roles simply are not. This means that quality digital job seekers are often presented with 2-3 job offers from different companies at a time, taking the competition from candidate VS candidate to hiring companies VS each other.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSo in this &lsquo;candidate-driven&rsquo; market where job seekers are seemingly having their pick of the top digital jobs available, what would make a technology candidate pick YOUR company over the two or three other companies offering them a role? And equally importantly, what is going to make them stay?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Techies want a deeper meaning...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-to-hire-techies-silicon-valley-insiders-explain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inc.com&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;techies are looking for something to work on which matters.&lt;i&gt;&ldquo;A mission, a narrative, a way to dent into the universe&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;. Does your company have a clear view of where it wants to be and by when, and can new recruits envision being a part of driving the companies success? Are your recruits bought into your company&rsquo;s mission and objectives? More to the point, is your mission worth investing in? You can&rsquo;t just pitch techies a role and hope they&rsquo;ll drop all other offers with &lsquo;&lt;i&gt;yep, that sounds great, count me in&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;. You need to paint a story of how their work will make an impact in what you are trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/brooklyn-our-lobby-in-sf.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Airbnb-EI_IE391850.11,17.htm?countryRedirect=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pic: Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Genius attracts genius&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTeam means more than you think.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-to-hire-techies-silicon-valley-insiders-explain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inc&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;also states that &quot;&lt;i&gt;who you work with appears to be nearly as important to software engineers as what you&rsquo;re working on. The most talented and interesting people in the world want to work with the other talented and interesting people. Genius attracts genius.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;It&rsquo;s important for tech professionals to be inspired in the workplace and have other people in the office that they can gain experience and wider knowledge from.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Up to date, cutting edge&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTechies want to work for companies that are continually improving and are current. Forward-thinking companies that candidates want to work for are exactly that &ndash; forward-thinking. They&rsquo;re always looking ahead for ways to continuously improve what they&rsquo;re doing and ensure they are keeping up to date with all the latest technologies, which keeps things fresh and exciting for their employees. If you&rsquo;re using a tech stack that&rsquo;s five years old whereas your competition is constantly upgrading their tools and technologies, you&rsquo;re likely to put yourself in a difficult position when trying to attract the right people to your organisation&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Company culture&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne of the biggest attractions for tech staff is company culture. Companies like&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/about/company/facts/culture/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/how-airbnb-is-building-its-culture-through-belonging/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;are praised for their amazing company culture. A positive working environment is a key priority for these companies and in return their employees enjoy working for them and tend to stick with them for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTech professionals are innovators, therefore their working environments should reflect this. The Silicon Valley giants we&rsquo;ve mentioned incorporate &lsquo;break out&rsquo; areas, where employees can get space to be creative and embrace new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOur client&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialforce.com/careers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FinancialForce.com&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;has embraced this into their working environment and company culture. FinancialForce staff are encouraged to use the break out rooms located around the offices, including free vending machines, play stations, and themed meeting rooms, moving away from the dryness of a typically corporate environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google says that&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/blog/why-everyone-wants-work-google-and-how-attract-those-employees-your-tech-business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Focusing on output rather than hours worked and treating employees well, with on-site facilities like allowing pets in the office and up-to-date technology, all helps to create an engaged, motivated and happy workforce and there is no reason why these kinds of perks can&rsquo;t be introduced at smaller tech companies too.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCan you offer your employees an attractive company culture? And a space where they are going to continue to innovate and perform?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Incentives and company perks&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile the projects and culture may be what initially attracts technology candidates to a role, the &lsquo;perks&rsquo; and the benefits of working for your company are what will make them stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHard work needs to be recognised. Techies, along with the majority of other professionals want to feel like they are appreciated for work and that their company recognises and respects their life outside of work also. For example:&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/blog/why-everyone-wants-work-google-and-how-attract-those-employees-your-tech-business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&ldquo;The opportunity to work at Google attracts professionals as it provides an industry-leading maternity package to its employees. Intel offers its employees compensation for completing their MBA and offers free tutoring services to employees&rsquo; children.&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/google-dublin.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n(Pic:&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/googles-culture-of-success/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NeilPatel.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nUnderstandably, smaller companies may not be in a position to offer all the same perks as those at Google and Facebook, but other perks such as flexible working opportunities and extended annual leave days are some of the things that definitely do not go unnoticed for technology professionals looking for a new company to join.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/nov/24/free-food-games-and-massages-why-techies-are-happy-at-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech jobs were found to be the best for work-life balance following feedback from UK and US employees:&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;web developer ranked highest in the UK, joined in the top 20 by data analyst, software engineer and design engineer. In the US, data scientist, SEO manager, social media manager and UX designer (user experience designer) led the pack. With the majority of companies hiring tech professionals seeming to be taking into consideration the above points, the results are paying off and clearly not to be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Are you a tech professional? Do you agree with the points we&#039;ve discussed? What attracts you to an organisation, and what makes you stick around? It would be great to get your thoughts.

vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Cashflow is key when starting and growing a company. Developing a primary MVP and supporting a live operational model requires cashflow. Whilst the traditional methods of funding are still available there are a vast array of other sources now such as crowd funding, private funding via high Net Worth individuals, venture capitalists, grants and innovation loans.&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Workforce Growth &ndash;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;One of the biggest decisions for any start-up is whether to outsource skills. Both have their benefits but ultimately finding and retaining talent is required and can be a challenge in itself, especially when recruiting for roles you may not be experienced in hiring for. Initiatives such as apprenticeships, training plans, flexible working and job sharing all attract and support the people needed to grow with your company. Finding companies that understand your sector and what talent you need to start to bring resource back in house, will be of great benefit.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Diversity &amp; inclusion &ndash;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Often overlooked in the early years of starting up a business but having a truly diverse and inclusive workplace allows for diverse exchange of opinions and knowledge and will ultimately enrich your company culture and staff engagement.&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Company Structure &ndash;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Just as lack of funding can be an issue, growing too quickly, taking on too many sales / contracts without the correct operational support can equally stunt a company. Taking the time to integrate core project management, development, sales and support processes that can scale with and underpin growth demands are vital for long term success. Without the correct internal processes and structure, businesses can find themselves stuck in a loop of gaining new sales but not retaining repeat business, which are the most profitable.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;You have recently been shortlisted in&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardladies.com/national-awards/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The STEM Rising Star category at the Forward Ladies Awards and Summit&lt;/a&gt;.

We have a thriving tech scene, which is supported by some passionate individuals, and it&nbsp; just keeps growing as the talent decides to stay here after they graduate from the three Universities. Leeds and Yorkshire are wonderful places to live and I believe people are beginning to realise that there is more to life than hunting for the biggest salary. We have a better work life balance, a booming tech hub and a beautiful countryside to go with it.

It is likely to be true that we do not attempt to store information in our own memory to the same degree as we used to, because we are confident in the reliability of the information found on the internet knows everything.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFurthermore, it is argued that innovations such as the internet, smartphones and tablets are affecting our ability to think critically and problem solve.&nbsp;The concern of many is that technology is in fact making us stupid.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Distraction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI&rsquo;m sure most of us will agree that technology is distracting. Whether it is stepping away from an important project to check your smartphone or flipping between browsers tabs without a real focus on one. We will have all been distracted by technology at some stage. It has been feared that this exposure to more distraction of this sort is in turn dumbing us down, with reports that distractions such as social media outlets could be responsible for lower exam results by up to 20%.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is also a limit to how much information your working memory can take in at once. Attempting to take in too much information, something that happens a lot online, is like &ldquo;having water poured into a glass continuously all day long, so whatever was there at the top has to spill out as the new water comes down,&rdquo; productivity expert Tony Schwartz told&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/technology-intelligence_n_5617181.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Huffington Post&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;last year.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Forgetfulness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/technology-intelligence_n_5617181.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;millennials are more likely to forget what day it is or where they put their keys than people over the age of 55, and technology has been cited as a major culprit behind this.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-scientist.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;magazine recently commented &ldquo;This is a population that has grown up multitasking using technology, often compounded by lack of sleep, all of which results in high levels of forgetfulness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The young and future generations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Google Effect will become a growing concern for parents as it is set to have the most notable effect on the younger generation in those under the age of 15 as well as future generations.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/24/tablets-apps-harm-help-children-read&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;recently reported that four years ago, just 7% of 5 to 15 year-olds in the UK had access to a tablet. By last year that figure was 71%. Some 34% of this age group even owned the tablets themselves, as well as 11% of 3 to 4 year-olds, according to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ofcom figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe popularity of tablets among children is a controversial topic, with differing views on the subject. Are these electronic devices with their apps, games and access to online video distracting children from more traditional, some might say &lsquo;more wholesome&rsquo;, activities, such as reading? Or preventing children from playing outdoors?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite these concerns, there are those that believe this notion of dumbing down by digital innovation to be nothing more than a conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell,&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;a vice-president at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/homepage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;believes so. She says technology &quot;helps us live smarter&quot; as we&#039;re able to access answers. &quot;Being able to create a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, as you quickly work out what information you want to extract and identify the app to help achieve this, suggesting a level of engagement with the world that&#039;s not about dumbness.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt could be argued that with so much access to unlimited information about everything and anything, technology surely has a positive impact on ability to learn and gain information.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhat are your thoughts?

She started her career in recruitment in the international Oil and Gas industry. &nbsp;Starting out in Manchester before moving to Leeds to set up the Oil and Gas team at an IT-focused recruitment agency. In this Q&amp;A shares with us her career path so far as well as more about her current role at BJSS and what it&#039;s like to work there...&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&nbsp;Your most recent role sees you as recruitment manager at &nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjss.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BJSS&lt;/a&gt;. Can you tell us a bit about what your job entails on a &nbsp;day to day?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s hardly a nine to five job. No two days are ever the same and I amaze myself at how much I can jam-pack in every day! My role is a new one at BJSS and one of my top objectives is to shape and run the company&rsquo;s recruitment capability. My team has to hire at least 150 people this year and we do that by working with our preferred agencies, sourcing and hiring candidates directly, growing our recognised&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjss.com/grad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BJSS Graduate Programme&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and headhunting. I am also on hand to guide our technical team whenever a candidate isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;obvious choice&rdquo; for BJSS. I come from the recruitment world so my understanding of this space helps me to give an experienced view on who we should and shouldn&rsquo;t be hiring.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like about your job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;The challenge mostly. This is a very demanding role in an ambitious and successful organisation that is made up of 600 very clever people. BJSS has a great culture and it&rsquo;s given me a great opportunity to grow and develop my career. I also like that the management team is approachable and always available, pushing me to improve continuously.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What are the challenges you face?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously, our team has to bring 150 new people into BJSS. The company prides itself on its robust recruitment standards, selecting only the best candidates. One of my biggest challenges is to ensure that we maintain these standards while finding ways to reshape and speed up our processes without compromising quality.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been in recruitment for 11 years, how has the industry changed through your career?&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I started my career in the oil and gas sector before taking the plunge into technology recruitment &ndash; a journey that gratefully led me to BJSS. The IT market is pretty similar to the international oil and gas market where skills are in increasing demand (albeit scarce), employers having to compete aggressively for top talent, and agencies running an account management approach based on headhunting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;BJSS is a massive company with a great reputation in the software industry. To someone that isn&rsquo;t familiar with BJSS, what do they do and how are they different to other software organisations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Well BJSS is an award-winning delivery-focused IT consultancy with over 20 years&rsquo; software delivery and IT advisory experience and we&rsquo;re renowned for technical excellence, cost-effective delivery, and our proven BJSS Enterprise Agile approach.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Can you tell us about what it&rsquo;s like to work there?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Brilliant! I love working here! The people are great, they&rsquo;re really talented and I learn so much from the brilliant projects they deliver. Our people get to use the latest technologies and tools and they love working on a variety of work. The benefits here at BJSS are great, we have amazing offices and we have a full social events calendar. It&rsquo;s a really happy environment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;If you were a software professional looking for a new role why would you want to work for BJSS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Very few companies can match the breadth of work, clients and technologies which BJSS offers. Our vision is to be recognised as the UK&rsquo;s leading privately-owned technology and business consultancy. To achieve this, we are progressively investing in the expansion of our capabilities so BJSS offers many opportunities for software professionals wanting to develop their skills and career paths.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The digital community in Leeds seems to be extremely vibrant at the moment. What do you think the appeal is to settle in Leeds for professionals and start-ups?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Leeds is a great city to live and work in. It has a casual vibe to it and it&rsquo;s a cool place to be. Everywhere is close, the cost of living better and there&rsquo;s a great quality of here. From a tech perspective, you can easily be at a tech meet up one evening and then finding yourself cycling through the Calder Valley the next evening.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What advice would you give to young people looking to pursue a career in the technology industry?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Contact me! ;) But on a serious note, get involved in the local tech community, ask from guidance from contributors on Stack Overflow and similar tools. If you chose a degree subject at 17 that no longer fits your career aspirations, that doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; companies are always ready to &lsquo;train up&rsquo; young people that fit into their culture.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso remember that your college&rsquo;s / university&rsquo;s career service can be incredibly helpful so make the most of it! Ask them to not only help you with career planning, but also to help draft and proof read your CV, and to prepare you for interviews. Some career services work directly with recruiters to help with placements, work experience and graduate schemes. If you approach a career service to help with opportunities, the service can contact recruiters on your behalf. Remember - you are paying for this service as part of your tuition fees - they are there to help you, so use them!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What have your experiences been so far working with Amsource Technology?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We have a great relationship with Amsource. The team understands our business and many of the candidates they send to us successfully progress through our recruitment process. &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What sets Amsource Technology apart from other recruiters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Amsource provides a high level of service.

The stereo type still lingers that boys are interested in more technical subjects like science, maths and I.T whereas girls are typically more stimulated by creative subjects such as English and the arts. At a young age a lot of girls maybe avoid being interested in things that are deemed &lsquo;boyish&rsquo; in hopes of fitting in with their peers. This is could be unfortunately contributing to the number of women studying technology related degrees and entering the tech sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;The fact that IT departments are heavily dominated by male employees could be putting women off from joining those departments. The lack of women can intimidate women into entering a profession where they may feel outnumbered or like outsiders. &nbsp;The lack of women in the industry also means that there is a real lack of women mentors who can guide other women and motivate them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A perceived Lack of effective promotion of the range of different roles available within the technology sector could be another factor. &nbsp;Not all roles in IT are purely technical and the range would appeal to different skill sets - Programmers, DBA&rsquo;s Testers, Business Analysts, Project Managers, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some factors aren&rsquo;t detracting women from entering the industry but are driving women to leave earlier once they enter.

I&#039;m sure there are companies you are interested in and would love to work for, so why not interact with them? Facebook gives you the opportunity to interact directly with the company, bridging the gap, giving you the opportunity to put your questions out there to the company and could potentially help you get your foot in the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A company Facebook page is designed for interaction with customers, so the company would love to hear from you, it&#039;s what it&#039;s there for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&#039;s not what you know, it&#039;s who you know:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Another way to make the most of Facebook in your job search is to take note of your Facebook friends. I&#039;m sure you will have hundreds of Facebook friends, working in hundreds of different job roles and companies - use your Facebook friends to see what it&#039;s like to work at these companies, many of your friends may even advertise role vacancies through their Facebook page, so it&#039;s always worth communicating with these people. I&#039;m sure you will have heard the phrase &#039;It&#039;s not what you know it&#039;s who you know&#039; so get to know these people. What&#039;s important to remember when using Facebook is that you are branding yourself online, brand yourself as the type of person you would want potential employers to see you as, and turn your privacy settings to high, be mindful of what content on your profile is private, you don&#039;t want those &#039;Magaluf 2012&#039; pictures to creep up and bite you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;A great functionality that Facebook has is the Facebook group option.

So, get involved!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;TWITTER&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep in the loop:&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2013/02/09/twitter-job-search/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is a great way to keep up to date with what companies are doing. Many companies have become very good at responding to tweets from followers, so ask questions and interact with as many companies as you can to get noticed.

Many companies will let their followers know through updates on Twitter, if they are hiring so it is always worth following those companies you are interested in to heighten your chance of working there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;LINKEDIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is the perfect social network for job seekers. It is a business orientated network, therefore businesses use LinkedIn to search for candidates. Potential candidates use their LinkedIn profile as an online CV. When creating a LinkedIn profile ensure you use a picture that is professional and reflects how you would like to be perceived. Use your headline to your advantage - make it easy for recruiters to find you. Let them know who you are and what you are looking for - in a sentence. Follow those brands you are interested in and would like to work for. The same with Twitter and Facebook - comment on company profiles on LinkedIn and share/like content they produce to make you more visible to these companies. Companies will often advertise when they are looking for new team members through LinkedIn so it&#039;s important to follow these companies so you can see these updates and know what action to take next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Linkedin also email users jobs that may be of interest to them based on the skills and interests they have listed on their profile. It&#039;s always worth checking these a company who may not already be on your radar may be offering your ideal opportunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;INSTAGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://jobsearch.about.com/od/social/fl/How-to-Use-Instagram-in-Your-Job-Search.htm&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is becoming more and more of a vital feature in the social job search for job seekers. Few companies will use Instagram to advertise jobs. However it&#039;s a great way for potential employers to see more of your personality. So it&#039;s a great tool for you to market yourself and let employers see more about you, what your interests are outside of your career. However if you don&#039;t want to market yourself from Instagram and you think the content you post won&#039;t help, but hinder your quest for a job - as suggested with Facebook, ensure privacy settings are set to high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;PERSONAL BLOGGING&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A great way to set yourself apart from other candidates is to blog about your interests, especially if your interests work hand in hand with your dream career. For a lot of employers a candidate who is genuinely passionate about their career is more attractive than a candidate who may just see their career as a paycheck at the end of the month. This shows employers that the job you have applied for isn&#039;t just a job to you, you really are interested in obtaining a career in this field. There are many social media sites now dedicated to making your own blog - for example -&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/blogging-help-hurt-job-search&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;. Many companies are also using Tumblr so it gives job seekers the opportunity to follow these companies and hopefully draw company attention to their own profile and blogs. Through these company blogs you may be able to understand the company more and what the culture of their company from this you can get a better understanding of whether you would like to work there or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&#039;s important to never underestimate the power of your social media profile, it could be what helps you find your next role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', '', '', 'the-social-job-search-have-you-started-yours-', 'yes', 'no', 1459987200),

(31, 'Top Skills You Need to Succeed in DevOps', 0, '', '', '22ecd9cec8cbdefda0e16618e455e6b4.png', '&lt;p&gt;DevOps is one of the biggest buzzwords in IT / software development right now, and it&rsquo;s only expected to get bigger. The collision of development and operations aims to enhance communication and collaboration between software developers and IT professionals, and the rapid growth of this market has resulted in huge demand for skilled DevOps professionals. As companies work smarter and introduce new technology, they&rsquo;re increasingly looking for people who can enhance their technical capacities and drive development efficiencies in the process. But what skills do you need to succeed in the world of DevOps?&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Experience with configuration management tools&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCandidates who can confidently use configuration management tools such as Chef, Ansible and Puppet will likely have an edge over those who cannot. These tools can help to support and optimise software deployment, and there are plenty of options to choose from. What&rsquo;s most important is the skill level of the DevOps professional wielding the tool, so whichever you choose, make sure you know it well.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Soft skills&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSoft skills can be as important as hard skills, if not more so, for employers. A 2013 Vanson Bourne&nbsp;survey&nbsp;found soft skills were the most in-demand attributes in a DevOps candidate, showing the need for professionals to be well-rounded. Clear communication, collaboration and flexibility are all desired by employers in the field, so job seekers would pay to focus on these skills alongside their more practical, technical knowledge.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;OpenStack knowledge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to a Dice salary survey, DevOps workers with OpenStack skills were amongst the top five highest paid employees. The cloud computing programme has set itself apart from the rest of the industry with its open source model and collaborative development process. It helps engineers to work quickly and maximises existing infrastructure, allowing for autonomy and innovation.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Learn programming languages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;Knowledge of programming languages is key for a variety of tech roles, and there&rsquo;s no exception for DevOps. Some of the more popular languages in this sphere include Ruby, Java, Python, Shell and Perl, but there are plenty on the market that&nbsp;offer&nbsp;something slightly different.&nbsp;Ideally&nbsp;a DevOps professional will have strong working knowledge of more than one language, so if you&rsquo;re looking to transition into this field or expand your career development opportunities, train up in a few.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Infrastructure insight&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDevOps&nbsp;engineers, in particular, should have a working understanding of data center-based and cloud infrastructure components. This includes aspects such as how software is racked in networked, methods for load balancing, running virtual machines and networking basics such as layers, networking in cloud and access between applications.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAre you ready to take the next step in your DevOps career?

An enduring theme amongst such failing projects was where organisations had adopted Agile for the first time, and in doing so had thrown away practices that had worked perfectly well for them in the past. Often this meant discarding all forms of planning and preparation in the name of emergent architecture and many-a-board covered in post-it notes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;A few of the anti-patterns I&#039;ve observed to be associated with such emergent (or omitted) architecture seem to be...&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Business value is the only driver of priority. Aspects such as risk or natural ordering of dependencies are disregarded.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Developer workflow jumping straight from business requirements to source code, with very little consideration of commonality or cross-cutting aspects&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Large-scale &#039;back-to-square-one&#039; refactors commonplace, often the same code being rewritten over and over and over again as new requirements are drip-fed in.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;No commonality of approach, different parts of the system solving similar problems in very different ways&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lsquo;Copy and paste&#039; employed as a reuse mechanism if time pressures precluded refactoring&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Non-functional requirements being ignored in favour of functional requirements, often rearing their head again in the path to go-live (or worse, in production).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if architecture is still needed, one thing that I think has happened is that the role of architects within Agile projects has evolved significantly as Agile has become mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Where we&#039;ve come from...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A traditional (if somewhat cynical view) paints a picture of an approach where Architecture was the preserve of a team sitting happily in their Ivory Tower, issuing decrees for the developer-folk to obey. Architecture was very much an upstream process, with designs flowing downhill but very little opportunity for feedback from the code-face as to what works in practice. A lack of code-level familiarity often led to over-engineering and reduced maintainability. Tactical decisions made downstream to &quot;get things done&quot; would lead to code that didn&#039;t match the design, or wasn&#039;t fit for purpose with respect to key non-functional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of this approach to Architecture was the sheer volume of documentation produced just to communicate between silos. Rather than spending their time thinking and designing, architects would spend the majority of the time writing lengthy documents, and a lack of face-to-face interaction would lead to a corresponding amount of time from the development team reading the self-same documents.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Where we&#039;ve got to...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under an agile approach architecture is now a much more integrated activity. The Architecture itself is vitally important, as it provides a framework and set of constraints with which to guide the design activities. In turn, those activities now being very much a collaborative effort involving architects and developers at the same whiteboard.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;This conveys a number of distinct advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Agile architecture is much more about thinking and communication; rich, compact documentation is still as important, but the production of reams of documentation for documentation&#039;s sake is diminished&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;An integrated feedback loop is provided, with the architecture, design and implementation constantly validating each other; that the implementation matches the design and the design operates within the framework set by the architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Given appropriate architectural constraints and guidelines, more of the design can be just-in-time leading to greater efficiency and more accurate low-level decision-making&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Everyone on the team contributes to the architecture (to a greater or lesser extent), not just those with the corresponding job title.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Architect now plays the role of the benevolent dictator, with a clear authority and veto, but no longer a lone voice shouting from afar. The pitfalls of design-by-committee are avoided, and a project retains a paper trail that is sufficient for on-boarding new developers, support of the system, and meeting client technical oversight requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural governance is still absolutely vital, and if anything is more important given the dynamic nature of an agile project. If anything, the transition being in the manner in which governance is applied - much less about writing a big (unread) book of rules &amp; principles up front, and more about getting inside the feedback loop and closer to the hands-on decision making (so ensuring there is an architectural governance aspect to the usual agile ceremonies - sprint planning, retrospectives, show-and-tells and the like).&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Emergent vs. Evolving Architectures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although my experiences with failing projects lead me to take a pretty dim view of emergent architecture, it is important that there is flexibility to change the architecture as the requirements change or are better understood. I&#039;d probably term this an evolving approach as opposed to an emergent one, with a number of key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Architecture identifies decision points and manages risks up front, but allows decisions to be deferred until later in order to provide flexibility of implementation.&nbsp;Refactoring is still an important tool, but it is a high-value activity to improve the system, rather than a constant tax needed to keep the wheels on.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;A level of up-front design allows the client&#039;s technologists to be engaged - they can review and have input to technical decisions before they are implemented.&nbsp;There are no sacred cows, we anticipate and expect that the architecture will change over time. The key thing being we start with something tangible with flexibility built-in, not just a blank sheet&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Constant grooming of technical debt; understanding that a small level of technical debt is often helpful in order to run a team efficiently and avoid gilding the lily, but actively managing this debt at the same time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In Summary...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like we architects aren&#039;t going away any time soon, if anything, you&#039;ll be seeing more of us...&lt;/p&gt;', '', 8, '', 'architect', '', 'mark-pullan-of-bjss-the-role-of-an-architect', 'yes', 'no', 1456012800);

This is done by showcasing original content with a compelling storyline. Having adopted a youth-driven perspective, FFS prides itself on curating fresh authentic media that is receptive to a nation of food lovers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to being a content creation hub, FFS has an inclusive online platform that enables users to discover premium dining offers based on location, timing and stock availability. This encourages vendors to drive profits from their bottom line whilst reducing food wastage and for users to discover the hidden gems that Leeds casual dining scene has to offer!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, Myles tells us more about their journey so far, how the For Fork Sake dream came to life, what it&#039;s meant to be shortlisted at the Leeds Digital Festival Awards, and more!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about your career path so far, what inspired you to start your own business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I always knew I would do something off my own back, I was just never sure what it would be. From an early age, my brother and I have always explored our own little ventures whether it was working with creatives, student radio or even selling sweets at our boarding school.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe both have a passion for most things creative, which I feel naturally lead us down the path of creative marketing and advertising. I have been fortunate enough to work with some of the worlds largest brands such as&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diageo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diageo&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imperialbrandsplc.com/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Imperial Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suntory.com/&quot;&gt;The Suntory Group&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and more. Bradley dare I say was even more fortunate to be able to work with&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/?ref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lsquo;Nike&#039;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;on an 8-week internship whilst filming &lsquo;Nothing Beats a Londoner&rsquo; (if you&rsquo;re from London and haven&rsquo;t seen it, check it out)!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFFS was birthed from the failure of a previous venture. Looking back now, it was the best thing to ever happen. Instead of doing a plethora of things to a mediocre standard, we cleaned up the business, streamlined, and now focus on delivering 3 things to an exceptional level.&nbsp; The inspiration for launching FFS came from a passion for bringing people together. It&#039;s something we do quite well, and what is one of the few things that connects every person on this planet? Food.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor us, food was the perfect vehicle to bring to life our expertise and passion under one roof.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/IMG_9789.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve had an interesting start-up journey, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&rsquo;ve learnt to date?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pretty obvious, but trust your gut.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI personally believe you need to stick your hand in the fire and get burnt to truly understand what it feels like. I am sure a large percentage of people reading this can recall to a time when they themselves were burnt. It&#039;s not nice, but it&#039;s necessary. The combination of logic and emotion, it&#039;s called intuition, use it.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFires are always burning, it&#039;s the nature of the beast, but the way you tackle each fire is the true determinator. By this, I mean when we started, there was no doubt we were working hard but does that necessarily mean we were working smart? Each task is interlinked, take the time to review tasks, because by putting out 2/3 small fires, you may directly extinguish the huge burning issue that has been stressing you out for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRelationships triumph everything. I would go as far as saying 85% of our key achievements or milestones were hit outside of the office, away from the desk and certainly not over email or a phone call. What I mean by this is we have closed some of our most important deals or imperative conversations in a social environment. Why? Because those environments are where you develop meaningful relationships, you go a level deeper than just a formal introduction.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTaking a GENUINE interest in people, remembering their name (even if you have to write it down), doing your research before meeting someone, all shows and will pay its way later down the line, I promise.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, enjoy the ride. I was fortunate enough to have a breakfast meeting with Zeus Capital Founder Richie Hughes, and he said &#039;life is a collection of experiences&rsquo; - looking back even over the past year, time goes so fast that you forget to actually enjoy the ride. Take time to appreciate the small wins, because further down the line it truly resonates how monumental they were. There will be times when things don&rsquo;t go to plan, but those moments don&rsquo;t define us. How we react to them, that&#039;s what really counts.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about the tech behind For Fork Sake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The platform is built from the ground up and offers two primary services. These services are:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n1. A social community-based system&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n2. An exclusive menu interface&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe technologies that make up the social system of the platform include a live forums system for consumers to speak directly and review their favourite dining places, a content hub that runs off live updates. It has the ability to earn money for influencers and build a portfolio that&#039;s based upon a tried system that provides more rewards and creates more jobs. It also allows for the businesses and business employees to directly communicate with their customers and beyond, providing a more meaningful and well-acknowledged business presence.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe exclusive menu interface will be one of a kind system, offering exclusive menus and offers to everyone so that they can try new experiences and cultures without &quot;forking&quot; a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOur system, much like the business, has been built to remain fluid and dynamic, with the ability to update or maintain any outside API changes.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/ffs1.0.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been shortlisted in this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/ldf-awards-2019-meet-the-shortlist--98829148241&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds Digital Awards for One To Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fantastic achievement! What can we expect from you this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know right, what an honour to even be recognised! Expect big things from the Jensen brothers, we have just returned from a very successful trip in the Big Apple and we are looking forward to working more closely with our USA counterparts. Our team has now grown to a sizeable 18 people, which means a lot more content, a lot more noise, and fork ton more users joining our community.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBradley and I launched a consultancy &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/wearejensen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jensen &amp; Jensen&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; to assist businesses with their own marketing and communication needs. We want to be able to demonstrate the possibility of impactful bootstrap marketing for those businesses just starting out.&nbsp; Now our focus is about delivering high-quality original content that engages our audience. We have a fantastic team behind us mixed with foodies, creatives and techies, all working extremely hard. In addition, we have just moved into our new home on Aire Street, to have a solid base for FFS is imperative to the growth of the company.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe are also working with a large production company, but that is still in the works so&nbsp;hush hush&nbsp;for the moment!&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/IMG_8974.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it about Leeds that makes it a great base for your business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was recently invited to the Leeds Digital Festival launch dinner, to which this was one topic of discussion. At the age of 24, I have lived in London, Birmingham, Spain, Liverpool and now Leeds. Leeds has something unique that I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other city, it&#039;s the true sense of collaboration and a willingness to truly help each other grow. Cities like London are an extremely competitive landscape, whilst Leeds is as well, I have found that people genuinely want to help and see others do well. You may find an investor or someone that would be really beneficial to the business, and they say unfortunately it is not for them but the difference to Leeds to many other places is they more than often will redirect or put you in contact with someone who&#039;s more suitable.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSecondly, students are our proving ground, and to have the most students per capita within the UK, Leeds seems to be the ideal home for FFS. Not to mention the bustling dining scene that is ever on the up within the city, with street food becoming more popular than ever and locations such as Kirkgate Market, Trinity Kitchen and Assembly Underground at our fingertips Leeds truly does appear to be the Mecca for a food tech business.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you give to other young entrepreneurs looking to get an idea off the ground?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone has ideas, that&#039;s the easy part. Look past the idea, to execute you need commitment and commitment requires time.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStick to it; follow the 48, 7, 14, 28-day rule: 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month. If you&#039;re still head over heels and restless at night about this idea post this period, then it is more than likely a good idea to pursue it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCapital is overrated and can often&nbsp;can&nbsp;cause more problems. You don&rsquo;t need money to start a business, you need initiative and creativity. A lack of capital breeds creativity, creativity breeds originality, originality breeds authenticity, and in a copy cat world, authenticity creates value.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEveryone can sell, no one wants to admit their weaknesses. A Google partner took me back to school when he asked me to draw a SWOT analysis of my business. Clearly, I could identify and shout to the top of my lungs the strengths and the opportunity that the model presented, but the weaknesses and threats were lacking. No one wants to admit to the possible drawbacks of their business, but these are what hold the most value. The same can be said for NOs (I see NO as &rsquo;Next Opportunity&rsquo;). Nobody wants a yes man, someone telling you are doing great doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything at all, someone telling you why they disagree with your views holds the most intrinsic value. That is a potential customer giving you insight and brands pay millions for that kind of feedback.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon&rsquo;t wait, just do it. I see way too many people attempting to perfect the logo, the website, the name&hellip; the dreaded name. Honestly, pick a name, and get to market. I know it&#039;s easier said than done, but get the bare bones of what you need to get to market and start working, this way you are immersing yourself fully, getting VALUABLE user feedback and learning on the way. 20 days of doing something is far better than 20 days of thinking to do something. Naturally, the brand will change as you scale, and more than likely so will your consumers.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHire people that are smarter than you, different to you and see the end goal. Naturally, no one will have the same passion for the business as you, but recruiting people that make up for attributes you lack, people that can envisage the end goal and genuinely smarter people will not only build a stronger team, but you as an individual will strongly learn and benefit from it.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, time is your biggest asset, by a long way. I feel the entrepreneurial life has been glamorised, to be this amazing thing that you work for yourself, do your own thing and get rich. It definitely isn&rsquo;t like that and the quicker you realise this the better - you are in it for the long haul. Buckle down and give this the full attention it deserves, no one is going to do the work for you (at least not yet), surround yourself with motivated, happy and smart people. You are a product of your environment, and as an entrepreneur, you need all the outside motivation you can get.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/ffs_final_pic_1.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-myles-jensen-of-for-fork-sake', 'yes', 'no', 1554940800);

You&rsquo;ve had a varied career so far. What initially prompted you to pursue a career in the technology sector?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I pretty much fell into it. After studying Geography at the University of Leeds between 1995-1998 my first job was in customer / tech support for Sage (UK) Limited in my home city of Newcastle. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about them beforehand but my dad is an accountant so when he saw they were holding a recruitment day he encouraged me to apply. I must admit it was a bit of a shock to the system but the training was fantastic, it paid well and the hours were good too as unlike other call centres, it was just Monday-Friday, 9-5. I was also dealing with quite complex queries about tax and payroll where you had to use your brain which kept things interesting. Even so, after 2yrs of being on a helpdesk I needed something &lsquo;more&rsquo;, started teaching myself basic web design in my spare time and landed a job as a Graduate Trainee Web Editor for British Airways in Newcastle which led on to all the other web and content marketing roles I&rsquo;ve had ever since, including a second stint at Sage as their &lsquo;Content Marketing &amp; Social Media Specialist&rsquo; between 2012-2015.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How has the tech sector changed in the last 10 years in the North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lsquo;The North&rsquo; has had many hugely successful IT and software companies over the years, including the aforementioned&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sage.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;which was founded way back in 1981 and has since grown to be the UK&rsquo;s biggest business software company and only tech business on the FTSE100. However, it&rsquo;s only really in the past 5-10 years that people started trying to join these digital-based companies up through networking and educational events and by marketing and promoting them as a collective whole known as the &lsquo;tech&rsquo; sector. Some of this was supported by the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) but most was done voluntarily by a bunch of enthusiastic individuals who wanted to create their own version of what they witnessed first-hand or heard was happening in places like Silicon Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Some of your more recent work has seen you working with Tech North. &nbsp;What are your thoughts on the &lsquo;Northern Powerhouse&rsquo; and the Tech North initiative?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technorthhq.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is loosely linked to the Northern Powerhouse concept which is all about rebalancing the UK economy, giving more power and focus to our Northern towns and cities which is something I and many others think is long-overdue. However, from what I heard on my weekly travels across the North I&rsquo;d say most Northerners actually hate the phrase, and see it as a quite patronizing and old-fashioned. Actions speak louder than words and unfortunately, most of the Northern Powerhouse conversations have been around transport infrastructure which is obviously important but very expensive and takes a long time to put into place. What I feel is more important and needed is an ongoing programme of small-scale events and initiatives that bring people together from across the North, opening their eyes to the opportunities and benefits of looking outside their local area to other towns and cities where they can network, collaborate and do business. This is what Tech North&rsquo;s &lsquo;Northern Stars&rsquo; competition has done very well by giving people a reason to travel to another city, often for the first time, to discover and celebrate what &lsquo;the North&rsquo; has to offer as a collective whole.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What has Tech North done to support the tech community in the North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;In addition to the &lsquo;Northern Stars&rsquo; competition, Tech North has done a huge amount of work to help shine a light on the great tech businesses in the North through their own blog and social media and this is something that they have really excelled at. Within the first few months it was surprising how many journalists and investors started getting in touch and enquiring about what was going on in the North, not realizing there was a tech sector up here which highlights why it&rsquo;s so important that someone is beating the drum for us and making sure we are not ignored by the national and international media. In the 8 months I worked as &lsquo;Community Engagement &amp; Partnerships Manager&rsquo; for Tech North, I spent a lot of my time matchmaking, making introductions between people and businesses, encouraging more collaboration within and between cities and putting small amounts of funding into events and initiatives which would bring people together and act as a catalyst to bigger things. I see this as a really important role for Tech North as unless they do this type of thing, I don&rsquo;t see anyone else doing it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;If you could describe tech in The North in three words what would they be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Innovative. Purposeful. Successful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What differentiates tech in The North apart from other up and coming tech clusters across the UK?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It&rsquo;s very hard to make sweeping statements about the whole of &lsquo;the North&rsquo; but in the early days of Tech North we did some work alongside the Northern Stars programme to try and understand what makes the North, &lsquo;the North&rsquo;, what makes it different to London and other parts of the UK, what connects our great Northern cities and what makes them all unique. What was really pleasing to see and hear is that there is a very deep social conscience across the North with people wanting to use &lsquo;tech for good&rsquo; and to tackle real-world problems. That&rsquo;s not to say people don&rsquo;t want to be rewarded and make good money from their work but many see this as a by-product of creating an excellent service that can make people&rsquo;s lives better. All 7 cities that Tech North primarily focused on &ndash; Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull, Sunderland and Newcastle &ndash; all have thriving tech communities that are well-defined and highly evolved meaning anyone wanting to start a business, open another office, relocate or invest there will be able to hit the ground running whilst making considerable cost savings compared to doing so in London.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Do you think the tech scene in the North can emulate some of the world&rsquo;s most well know areas such as Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, Berlin and London?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I don&rsquo;t think we should try to emulate any of those places as each one has evolved due to their very special and unique set of circumstances caused by economics and geography. Having said that, there are things we can learn from how other tech clusters have developed and two books I would highly recommend are &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Flat-White-Economy-Digital-Transforming/dp/0715650653/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477434346&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flat+white+economy&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=b1c56639d0c4a33b8a66f6ef42aa7d65&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Flat White Economy: How the Digital Economy is Transforming London and Other Cities of the Future&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Douglas McWilliams and &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477434435&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=Brad+Feld&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=72e61039a55eafc0512333592b1ddf86&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Brad Feld which have both informed my work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What does the North need to do in order to compete?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Be much bolder with our place marketing and messaging, but be honest with it too. We &lsquo;Northerners&rsquo; are often guilty of not doing enough to celebrate and shout loud enough about our successes because no-one likes a bragger or a loudmouth do they? However, if we don&rsquo;t do it who will? And if other cities and countries are better at this than we are, then the money and the talent will go to where it looks more exciting and our economy will suffer. At the same time, if we over-promise and under-deliver people will soon see through this and the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupheatmap.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Heatmap Europe Report&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;published earlier this year showed that in the case of Manchester, tech startup founders are saying that the reality does not live up to the hype.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Who are the real success stories of technology in the North of England?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There are way too many to list but anyone who has started and grown a profitable tech/digital business in the North that has created jobs where there is less hype and money to go around deserves high praise indeed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Is there one company who stand out?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Having worked for them twice and seen what a truly awesome company they are from the inside, I&rsquo;d say no-one comes close to Sage. They really are a phenomenally successful company that has created great products, jobs and wealth for hundreds of thousands of people over the years. It frustrates me that our British media and politicians often talk about wanting to create the next Google or Facebook when really they should be looking at the ingredients that led to the creation and growth of Sage and holding them up as the benchmark that others should aspire to be. Everyone in the UK should be proud to have such a hugely successful company as them which still has its&rsquo; global headquarters in the North of England.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would you say are the biggest challenges facing the digital northern powerhouse from becoming an internationally recognised digital hub?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We need more collective, joined-up efforts to promote &lsquo;the North&rsquo; as a collective whole on an international stage - encouraging foreign investors, businesses and talent to move to our Northern cities. This is something that Tech North were starting to do but they&rsquo;ve recently made their &lsquo;Trade and Investment Director&rsquo; redundant which means they have no-one with the skills, knowledge and international networks to do this well in their team anymore. It&rsquo;s even more important now that our Northern businesses and local councils work together and with national government to make sure that we are given the chance to promote ourselves on the world stage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been called a &lsquo;Super-Connector&rsquo; by your peers in the tech community. Tell us what that means and what you do.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;About 5 years ago I read &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0349113467/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477436654&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+tipping+point&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=222941c587c0533eb44ee8080748acc7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Make a Big Difference&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Malcolm Gladwell which explains why some great ideas work and others don&rsquo;t. In it, he talks about how in order for great ideas to spread like wildfire you need three types of people &ndash; Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. I was already pretty good at marketing (which is a form of selling) and I enjoyed discovering and sharing new ideas both at work and in my spare time so I decided then that I would set out to be the best I could be at all three things and have become known for doing this type of thing well for both employers and people around me who excite me through their work. My role at Tech North was the first time I was paid to do this type of thing on a full-time basis but it&rsquo;s only when I started my own business, Plan Digital, in April 2016 that I started calling myself a &lsquo;SuperConnector&rsquo; which is a bit tongue in cheek yet a totally apt description for the type of work that I do. After 6 months of doing this, it was really satisfying to be presented with the &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/top-north-east-tech-talent-12060230&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Collaborator of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; (sponsored by Accenture) at the Dynamites16 event last week!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absolutely delighted to win &#039;Collaborator of the Year&#039; at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dynamonortheast&quot;&gt;@DynamoNorthEast&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dynamites16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Dynamites16&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;awards! ?????????????????&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechNorth?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TechNorth&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThisIsMINE?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ThisIsMINE&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ybh2vgHNb0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ybh2vgHNb0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&mdash; Paul Lancaster (@lordlancaster)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lordlancaster/status/789262519575711744&quot;&gt;October 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your latest project sees you working with Digital Agenda which focuses on &lsquo;technology for a change&rsquo;. Could you tell us more about this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Agenda&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is a recently-launched news and events platform which focuses on technology and digital innovation that has a positive social impact on people, places and businesses. Because of my background working for not-for-profits and social enterprises, I like to think of myself as a &lsquo;Social Entrepreneur&rsquo; and so am particularly interested in technology that is for impact, not just for profit which is why I&rsquo;m supporting Digital Agenda. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve been helping the team with their positioning, partnerships and sponsorships which include a series of roundtable dinner debates hosted by KPMG in Newcastle, Leeds and Manchester which have so far been sponsored by Muckle LLP and your good selves at Amsource Technology. We&rsquo;re also working on a big &lsquo;Impact Awards&rsquo; event at The Barbican in London in March 2017 which will celebrate the most impactful technology from across the UK. In my humble opinion, Digital Agenda&rsquo;s founder and editor, Julian Blake, is one of the UK&rsquo;s finest journalists so if you want to know more about &lsquo;social impact&rsquo;, please check out his excellent work at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.digital-agenda.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and get in touch if you&rsquo;d like to sponsor a future dinner or one of the awards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;We sponsored Digital Agenda&rsquo;s City Impact dinner at KPMG in Leeds on the 18th, discussing how technology can continue to make changes to better our city. &nbsp;What was the purpose of the event?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;The purpose of the &lsquo;City Impact&rsquo; dinners is to bring up to 30 entrepreneurs, academics and public sector officials together over dinner to discuss some of the biggest challenges facing their respective city and to consider or suggest ways that technology is already or can be used positively in the future. Apart from being a great social event with stimulating conversation that is summarized in Digital Agenda articles like &lsquo;Leeds responds to future challenges&rsquo;, this is often the first time that some of these people have been in the same room together and so it&rsquo;s exciting to see new partnerships and collaborations forming which otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t and this is how new innovations and breakthroughs often occur.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In order for Digital Agenda to be a success what are the outcomes you&rsquo;d like to see it deliver?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lsquo;Social Impact&rsquo; is still a relatively new term and not many people know what it is until you explain it. However, once you do there is a real appetite for this type of work and so I hope that more people support what the Digital Agenda team are trying to do either by reading and sharing the content, attending the events or even sponsoring the programme of activity if they&rsquo;re in a position to do so. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s often the most important work in society that has the least funding behind it so it&rsquo;s vital that people and businesses support initiatives like Digital Agenda if they want to see better business practices highlighted and rewarded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo find out more please visit&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.digital-agenda.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, Follow us on Twitter&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DigitalAgenda_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@DigitalAgenda_&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and Like us on Facebook&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/digitalagenda2016/?fref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIf you would like to collaborate with Amsource Technology on future guest blogs please get in touch&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:raj.bains@amsource.io?subject=raj%20bains&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-paul-lancaster-the-north-s-super-connector', 'yes', 'no', 1565049600),
(36, 'A Q&amp;A With Stuart Clarke, Founder of Leeds Digital Festival', 0, '', '', 'd91e38e2565b19daa7115e3be7ed1dcb.png', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;After a career building marketing and corporate relationship teams for the likes of Alliance &amp; Leicester, first direct and TD Bank of Canada, I co-founded a successful marketing consultancy working with clients across the professional services, digital and arts sectors. We help firms create long term strategic plans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;m also an advisor and non-executive director to a number of start-ups, and the co-founder and Festival Director of the Leeds Digital Festival, as well as being a member of the Leeds Digital Board and the co-founder of Media Yorkshire.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially interested you in exploring a career in digital?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I started my marketing career many years ago, before all the great tools we have now were available, so my journey was one of adopting digital methods and tools as they came along, rather than leaping into a digital career. Instead of waiting a couple of months to find out whether a direct mail pack was successful, it&rsquo;s great to be able to test campaigns on an almost real-time basis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;re the founder of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leedsdigitalfestival.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds digital festival&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lsquo;the north&rsquo;s largest digital festival&rsquo; can you tell us about how you came up with the idea, and how it&rsquo;s grown to the size that it has?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As with all the best ideas, it started in a pub. I invited a group of people working in the sector (a &ldquo;coalition of the unwilling&rdquo; according to one of the group, Alex Craven from Jaywing Intelligence) to discuss how we could make more noise about the great talent and innovative companies that we have in Leeds, and also how to create more collaboration in the city.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nI took on the role as Festival Director to see if we could get a festival going. Leeds City Council helped us with a grant, then we brought other sponsors on board and before we knew it, three months later we had the first festival happening.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe first Leeds Digital Festival in 2016 saw 56 events; the 2017 version had 115 events, with over 400 speakers across 58 venues. Over 10,000 people came together to hear about the many incredible things we&rsquo;re creating in this city. It&rsquo;s grown because we&rsquo;re giving people and companies an outlet to tell the city and the world about the great stuff we do, but also because it&rsquo;s a chance for collaboration.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe were very clear about having a city-wide, open platform Festival, where people can put on what they want; there are no curators telling you what is right or wrong. Most of the events are free which enables everyone to take part.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve started planning next year&#039;s Festival and already have some great events planned. Of course, we&rsquo;re always looking for sponsors, so please get in touch if you can help.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You work with a number of interesting start-ups in Leeds. You&rsquo;re also a founder of the&nbsp;London to Leeds project. Can you tell us more about that and what differentiates the start-up scene in Leeds compared to others across the UK?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I think the biggest difference in Leeds to other cities is that we&rsquo;re much more collaborative. There are over 25 tech meetups each month for example, where people from different companies come along and share best practice. This also applies to the startup sector where founders can be seen at events like Founders&rsquo; Friday at Futurelabs, sharing their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe scale of the city helps; even though Leeds is the third biggest city in the UK, the compact size of the city centre makes it easier to work with other companies.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re also seeing more students stay in the city after graduation to build their startup; they no longer feel that London is the only place to be. You can build your company and have a great standard of living here, which isn&rsquo;t always the case in London. Accommodation is a third of the price in Leeds compared to London and the beer is cheaper (and better!).&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe London to Leeds project encourages startups and tech companies in London to visit Leeds and find out what a great, digitally-connected city it is, brimming with talent. I take visitors on a walk through the city centre, that usually ends up walking through the Victoria Quarter and then to a bar like Headrow House; even die-hard Londoners are impressed with the buzz of the city.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would you say to a start-up torn between choosing Leeds or London as a base for their business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nLondon obviously has many things going for it, it&rsquo;s the tech capital of Europe, but it doesn&rsquo;t suit everyone. As I mentioned above, the compact nature of Leeds makes it easier to find all the people you need; your funding can also go much further in Leeds. Leeds is only a couple of hours from London by train, so if you need to visit a customer or investor, it&rsquo;s easy to do so from your highly-affordable office.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The technology &lsquo;brain drain&rsquo; is something that is heavily documented in the industry at the moment. Large tech employers based in the region including (Sky Bet &amp; Asda) are finding hundreds of their vacancies are being left unfilled. Your work with Signin sees you working with universities in the area to help retain tech talent in our city and counteract this problem. Can you tell us more about this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Any conversation about the digital sector in Leeds invariably ends up as a discussion about skills and talent. We do need more people to fill the vacant roles and as a city we&rsquo;ve seen some really positive moves over the last couple of years. The universities and companies are closer than ever, which helps to keep graduates in the city; bigger firms such as Sky Bet and NHS Digital are also investing heavily in apprenticeships and graduate schemes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a city, we&rsquo;re now making more noise about how great it is to live and work here, and that promotion is bringing people to the city to work. With a mix of homegrown talent, graduates staying in the city and people moving to Leeds, we should keep the talent pipeline topped up.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nSignin&nbsp;is an innovative startup that connects universities, students and graduates, to match internships and graduate roles with the right applicants, which will hopefully contribute to closing the talent gap. The founder,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/by-george-leeds-graduate-s-new-app-is-winning-top-marks-1-8750682&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George Biddle&lt;/a&gt;, is a great example of Leeds keeping hold of its students. Originally from Solihull, after graduating from Leeds University George could have set up Signin in London or back home, but wanted to stay in Leeds because it has everything he needs to build a successful company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Leeds is booming with activity in the tech sector. What digital advancements / investments would you like to see in Leeds in the next couple of years?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We&rsquo;ll start to see the impact of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.leeds.gov.uk/new-tech-hub-set-to-arrive-in-leeds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds City Council&rsquo;s &pound;3.7m tech hub fund&lt;/a&gt;, which was invested across a number of projects. The first,&nbsp;Futurelabs, has already seen dozens of jobs created in software startups; the Platform tech hub, above Leeds City Station comes online in November. Together with the Open Data Institute and Duke Studios, these centres of digital and creative innovation will further cement Leeds&rsquo; reputation as the digital capital of the north.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ll also see more access to funders, the lack of which has sometimes held back the growth of digital companies. TechNorth are launching their Angel Network in the autumn; alongside the likes of NorthInvest and ADV, we should see more investment in the sector.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAbove all, I&rsquo;d like to see everyone keep banging the drum for Leeds on a city, national and international stage. Leeds is a great city and we should be shouting more about it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&#039;re getting more national coverage now than we used to, for example, Sky News&#039; Swipe tech show recently featured three innovative startups from Leeds; let&#039;s keep pushing the message that Leeds truly is the Digital Capital of the North.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGvOS0HnNpQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor further&nbsp;&lt;b&gt;information&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;visit&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stuartclarke.co.uk/&quot;&gt;stuartclarke.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', 'Leeds Digital Festival', '', 'a-q-a-with-stuart-clarke-founder-of-leeds-digital-festival', 'yes', 'no', 1507075200);

Leeds has something unique that we haven&rsquo;t seen in any other city. It&rsquo;s the true sense of collaboration and a willingness to truly help each other grow. Cities like London are an extremely competitive landscape, whilst Leeds is as well, we have found that people genuinely want to help and see others do well. You may find an investor or someone that would be really beneficial to the business, and they say unfortunately it is not for them, but the difference to Leeds to many other places is they more than often will redirect or put you in contact with someone who&#039;s more suitable.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/Top_7_Start-up_Cities_UK2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://technation.io/about-us/national-network/wales/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is being recognised as one of the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;fastest growing&nbsp;digital cities.

(41, 'The Life of a Software Tester', 0, '', '', 'a4a6a05665c76909e575964a0fbadfc9.png', '&lt;p&gt;Software Testers are an asset to any software team and as technology continues to innovate and develop the demand for Testers is set to continue.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHave you ever wondered what exactly it is a Software Tester does? Are you considering a career in Software Testing? In this blog Software Tester&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-marshall-95847235?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=REb4&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A123570644%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-3-3%2CtarId%3A1463570105370%2Ctas%3Abeth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beth Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;answers some questions about the role of a Tester and offers some tips to those seeking a career move into the sector...&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In your own words, what does a Software Tester do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;This can be a tricky question to answer! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a common theme amongst testers that their families and friends struggle to understand &nbsp;what we actually do. From my point of view, a &nbsp;software tester uses a variety of techniques and skills to review software with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of what goes out of the door. &nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, a good tester doesn&rsquo;t spend their time criticising developers, or finding as many bugs as possible.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;A lot of software testing, in reality, is about using your common sense, remaining pragmatic in challenging delivery environments and ensuring quality is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s your career journey so far?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;Like a lot of QA&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t dream about testing software for a living when I was a youngster &ndash; in fact I had no idea it even existed as a &nbsp;viable career choice until I was in my mid-twenties! &nbsp;After completing a Law and Criminology degree at Sheffield University, I landed a &nbsp;role as a Project Co-odinator at the award-winning software consultancy&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjss.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BJSS&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;Headquarters in Leeds. &nbsp;An opportunity arose to join a team tasked with reviewing a large set of manual test scripts. &nbsp;After proving I could hold my concentration whilst reviewing hundreds of test scripts I was asked if I wanted to become a junior tester on the same project, and was able to apply the knowledge I&rsquo;d learnt on the software itself.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the following 9 years I progressed from QA, to Test Lead and Test Management roles for clients all over the world, was lucky enough to work throughout the UK and US and made the big leap into contracting in 2015. Like a lot of people, it took an amazing mentor (you know who you are!) to sing my praises and open some doors, a lot of hard work and fair old chunk of good luck to get me to where I am now. I love working in a thriving tech community, and look forward to many more years of testing in Yorkshire!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s an average day like for you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;m currently working as a consultant Test Lead, which I&rsquo;m absolutely loving. &nbsp;My current client is&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.providentfinancial.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Provident Financial&lt;/a&gt;, a FTSE 100 finance company based in Bradford. A typical day involves attending stand ups, stakeholder meetings, organising workload for the test team, liaising with a tonne of people to ensure the test team are on track. &nbsp;I get involved early on in the delivery cycle to review requirements, trying to spot issues early on. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not above scripting and executing test cases either! &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like most about being a Software Tester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Honestly, I enjoy getting great quality software out of the door on time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work on some pretty high profile pieces of work for some of the world&rsquo;s biggest companies, so I&rsquo;ve seen lots of things go live from FX Trading Platforms to major E-Commerce websites and it&rsquo;s an awesome feeling when something important enough to generate nasty headlines and damage a companies&rsquo; reputation if it&rsquo;s wrong gets released and&hellip;. It works! &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I also love establishing a team and making stuff better &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s improving cohesion between dev and test, or championing new ways of working which take off. &nbsp;There are always opportunities to learn new things, and lots of networking events in Yorkshire to meet like-minded professionals and exchange ideas. &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What attracts you/Software Testers to a company?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;ve asked a lot of software testers this question, and whilst everybody&rsquo;s different there are definitely some key themes:-&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n1)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Recommendations &ndash; the northern software testing community is a surprisingly small world, and people tend to know at least a couple of folk who work or have previously worked for most of the big hitters. If a company is rated by someone you rate this will probably trump most other factors. &nbsp;Similarly if a linkedin search of the company brings up a glut of former colleagues who don&rsquo;t have a great reputation but who&rsquo;ve been kept on for ages then it&rsquo;s a massive red flag.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2)&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;Technology/Domain &ndash; This seems to be less important to testers than developers, but if there is a particular area you want to break into e.g. Finance, banking or e-commerce or a technology or tooling suite you want to get involved in e.g. automation you&rsquo;re likely to be willing to take a salary hit in the short term to get the experience you need. &nbsp;Take a look at the top 30 skills real employers are looking for using itjobswatch to make sure you&rsquo;re skills are current and identify any skills gaps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Training opportunities &ndash; Any company that invests in up skilling and nurturing its testing talent shows it&rsquo;s a good place to work. &nbsp;Even for a contractor, where you are expected to hit the ground running, it&rsquo;s a good indication of a good working environment if permanent staff are given opportunities to grow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Structure &ndash; Personally, I like to work at places with flatter management structures, which listen to the team&rsquo;s suggestions and give everyone a voice. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been really put off some companies when I hear that the developers sit away (sometimes on a different site) from the test teams, as in practice I&rsquo;ve found there&rsquo;s no substitute for face to face communication (usually at the pub!). &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What are your top three tips for someone considering a career move as Software Tester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &ndash; as often as you can! It&rsquo;s amazing the doors which open for you if you put yourself in a position to accept new challenges and stay positive and approachable&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;If you are the sort of person who needs to be constantly challenged and hates routine, then testing might not be the job for you. There is a heck of a lot of repetitive but necessary work, and if you cut corners you won&rsquo;t last long. &nbsp;If you are a completer finisher you&rsquo;ll love it!&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Get your&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istqb.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISTQB&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;qualification &ndash; there&rsquo;s varied opinions on how valuable this is to you in your day-to-day role, but for very limited cost and time commitment it&rsquo;s the best way of proving your interest in a career in software testing to recruiters and future employers alike.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThere are a lot of tips to be found in Beth&#039;s earlier guest blog post &ldquo;Testers top 10 ways to keep your job&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/testers-top-10-ways-to-keep-your-job-guest-blog-by-beth-68222145242&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;Keep up to date with more from Beth by following her on Twitter&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a data-show-count=&quot;false&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Beth_AskHer&quot;&gt;Follow @Beth_AskHer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere at Amsource we recruit a lot in the Software Testing market.

(42, 'A Q&amp;A with Kane Fulton of Tech North', 0, '', '', 'e8f32e0b0491a7467fabb3c59549b889.png', '&lt;p&gt;Kane Fulton has been the Community Engagement Manager for Yorkshire for Tech North since January 2017. He was previously the Computing Editor at the TechRadar, the UK&#039;s biggest consumer tech website. Kane graduated from Leeds Trinity with a journalism degree in 2009, landing his first writing gig at Shoreditch-based enterprise IT magazine Information Age in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSeeking a role that would allow him to tap into his love of computers, gadgets and consumer tech in general, he joined TechRadar as staff writer a year later. He worked his way up to Computing Editor, taking the helm of one of the website&#039;s most popular sections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter interviewing the director of Leeds Digital Festival for a feature, his interest in the city&#039;s startup scene was piqued. After persuading TechRadar to let him return to live in Leeds, he took on a second role interviewing local tech companies in addition to his everyday duties. Nine months later he successfully applied for a role with Tech North, a government-backed organisation set up to champion the North of England&#039;s tech sector. He now spends his time travelling Yorkshire interviewing its many stakeholders &ndash; from startups and corporates to accelerators, co-working spaces and public sector leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your current role sees you as Community Engagement manager at Tech North, can you tell us more about Tech North and what your role entails?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North&lt;/a&gt;, part of Tech City UK, is a government-backed organisation that was set up nearly three years ago to accelerate the growth of tech startups in the North of England. If startups are aeroplanes looking to take off, our job is to clear any obstacles on their metaphorical runway. There are many problems that could keep a startup founder up at night (and they&#039;re not always what you would expect!), so the challenge is identifying where we can make the most impact through our programmes and initiatives. We do this by homing in on &lsquo;five areas of focus&#039;, the first of which is profile-raising.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-stars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Stars&lt;/a&gt;, our pitch competition that shines a light on the best early-stage startups in the region, is a major component of this; we also publish Tech Nation and other reports about the sector, in addition to articles about startup founders (and other stakeholders in the ecosystem) on TechNorthHQ.com. The other areas of focus are investment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/investment/introducing-tech-north-angel-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North Angel Network;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/co-investment-fund/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co-investment fund)&lt;/a&gt;, skills (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-voices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Voices; UpSkill&lt;/a&gt;), ecosystem (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/founders-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Founders&#039; Network;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;alongside identifying what we need more of &ndash; coworking spaces and accelerators, for example), and partnerships (securing private sector sponsorship for Tech North events and programmes). As community engagement manager for Yorkshire, my role is to be the eyes and ears of Tech North on the ground, and a visible presence for startups in the region. I help founders in a variety of ways &ndash; from connecting them with other stakeholders in the ecosystem to explaining how our programmes could help them. That&rsquo;s just the start.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you enjoy most about your role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As a trained journalist (my previous roles have included writing for enterprise IT publications and editing TechRadar.com&rsquo;s computing channel), I always enjoy interviewing startup founders from Yorkshire and hearing their fascinating stories. Just last week, for example, I discovered that a company in Leeds was the first in the country to import and use the internet to sell Pok&eacute;mon and YuGiOh toys in the 90s. Founders tend to be highly appreciative of coverage due to a lack of attention on the region from the mainstream media. One recently offered to pay me for my time after I&rsquo;d filmed a video on their company &ndash; it goes without saying that I politely declined! Content aside, satisfaction comes from the small things &ndash; such as seeing people chat enthusiastically before swapping contact details at Founders&rsquo; Network breakfasts; hosting a successful event that fill&rsquo;s a venue&rsquo;s capacity; or seeing a startup founder deliver a knockout pitch in front of 200 people at a Northern Stars regional heat. I also run the local networking group&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/yorkshirestartups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yorkshire Startups on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. People now post on it daily, and it&rsquo;s great to watch that constant buzz emanate from the local startup community.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What challenges do you face in your role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Ensuring that all parts of Yorkshire feel like they&rsquo;re being served is a top challenge. Being something of a one-man band, I wish I had the ability to be in two (three or four) places at once &ndash; I&rsquo;m often having to apologise to people for not being seen as much as they would like and have to remind them that Yorkshire is a big place! On a related note, it&rsquo;s no secret that transport in the North is, shall we say, underwhelming. Trains are often packed, delayed and involve moving through routes where 4G signals are patchy (at best) &ndash; so adapting to working on the move has been a constant challenge since I started my role back in January. Juggling my responsibilities is another, and one that requires a structured approach to the day. Tools like Feedly, Trello, Slack, Evernote and Airmail 3 are invaluable in keeping on top of my workflow. Each day begins with a browse through bookmarked news websites to fill my&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuzzel.com/kanefulton/yorkshirestartups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yorkshire Startups newsletter&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;before 9am. After that, I&rsquo;m either meeting tech companies, promoting Tech North&rsquo;s events and activities, writing articles (or shooting video), or undertaking admin duties. Usually it&rsquo;s all the above at once.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;How&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechNorthHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TechNorthHQ&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is working to boost investment in the North of England.&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OWUsitMBI5&quot;&gt;https://t.co/OWUsitMBI5&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qdAJyYQQTQ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qdAJyYQQTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Tech North (@TechNorthHQ)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechNorthHQ/status/922427387010342912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 23, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In your career you have worked in both London and Yorkshire, how does the Northern tech scene compare to London?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Yorkshire&rsquo;s tech scene is more laid back than London&rsquo;s. This is something of a double-edged sword &ndash; where founders in the capital can perhaps go overboard on the self-promotion front (driven by a need to stand out in a packed scene), Yorkshire&rsquo;s startups tend to be somewhat introverted and reluctant to sell themselves. Many of them should be shouting from the rooftops about the brilliant work they&rsquo;re doing &ndash; something that our friends across the Pennines have mastered in recent years. But we&rsquo;re getting better. Also, the more intimate nature of Yorkshire&rsquo;s tech scene means that people are less guarded up here, which makes them more open to collaboration. I&rsquo;ve seen tight bonds forged between startup founders, and a particular willingness from corporates to engage. People are rarely too busy to make time for a coffee to scope out potential opportunities, which is great. Other differences between the two scenes are fairly obvious &ndash; there&rsquo;s simply far more of everything in London &ndash; from startups and coworking spaces to accelerators and incubators. On the flip side living and workspace rental costs are stratospheric compared to the North, which means that a startup could enjoy a much longer runway in Yorkshire to get their idea off the ground before scaling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;There is an immense buzz around the start-up scene in The North. Your role sees you working on initiatives such as the Northern Stars Scheme. Can you tell us more about Northern Stars and how it supports northern start-ups?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Northern Stars is a pitch competition designed to find and raise the profile of the most promising tech startups in the North. Now into its third year, our previous winners have raised more than &pound;6 million in funding since appearing on the programme. We receive hundreds of applications from startups based in the region, and after three regional heats and a grand final &ndash; both of which see startups deliver three-minute pitches to a live audience &ndash; end up with 10 of the best. Northern Stars is attractive to startups for many reasons: first and foremost, it gives them an opportunity to display their pitching mettle (and what their startup is all about) in front of a sizable audience. For others, it&rsquo;s more about the prize package, which this year includes a stand at TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin; access to investors at a private event held at the London Stock Exchange; media and pitch training; a stand at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam; and a place at the Northern Tech Awards, among others.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Read all about our visit to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthernStars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NorthernStars&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Leeds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Leeds&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in our latest blog&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4oB0GXoFFo&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4oB0GXoFFo&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Tech&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Startups?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Startups&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalNorthernPowerhouse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DigitalNorthernPowerhouse&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0dBoukRm7i&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0dBoukRm7i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Amsource Technology (@AmsourceTech)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmsourceTech/status/908710664339849217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there any start-ups in the North that stand out to you at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Yes &ndash; many! In Leeds,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kwizzbit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kwizzbit&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(a mobile pub quiz app) and&nbsp;Love Bomb Cushions&nbsp;(a retailer of emoji-themed cushions marketed with an augmented reality app) have found success after appearing on Dragons&rsquo; Den recently. Blind dating app&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jigtalk.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JigTalk&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;recently moved from Leeds to Manchester, which I&rsquo;ve only just forgiven them for (insert wink emoji), did brilliantly to win a place on the prestigious&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://business.nasdaq.com/discover/the-center/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASDAQ&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;accelerator in San Francisco.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fllike.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fllike&lt;/a&gt;, a flight rating app based in Leeds, has one of the slickest interfaces I&rsquo;ve seen on an offering developed in the North. Machine learning-powered revision app&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://synap.ac&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synap&lt;/a&gt;, also from the city, is consistently upping its B2B game. Sheffield&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tutora.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tutora&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is going from strength-to-strength having just revamped its online learning platform, and Slanted Theory from the steel city is developing interesting and interactive VR solutions that aid data analysis.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yboo.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yboo&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;from Holmfirth has developed what is possibly the most comprehensive app on the planet for helping consumers pick a mobile tariff &ndash; keep an eye on them. Over in Hull,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ash.tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ash.tv&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is going great guns with their mobile video advertising platform and have opened new offices in Amsterdam and Paris since winning Northern Stars last year. The success of software development studio&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcstudios.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arc Studios&lt;/a&gt;, also from the city, cannot be ignored &ndash; they went from winning an award at the Hull Digital Awards to sponsoring a category a year later! There are many other promising startups in the North &ndash; I&rsquo;d be here all day if I were to name them all. Keep a lookout on Tech North&rsquo;s website for our upcoming Ecosystem Map, which will list their names and locations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What other initiatives will Tech North be working on over the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Northern Stars and Founders&rsquo; Network, our peer-to-peer network for early-stage startup founders, run into 2018. We will also be developing two programmes related to helping startups secure investment (detailed in the answer below). Following the positive reception we received to Northern Voices, a speaker-training programme that aims to help to redress challenges like gender or regional imbalances in the sector, it will likely be rebooted in February next year. We will also be producing another Northern Tech 100 League Table, which this year ranked the fastest 100 growing tech companies in the North. There are other initiatives in the pipeline that we&rsquo;ll announce on our website when ready.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What challenges do you feel are most prominent in Northern Tech at the moment? (How do we overcome them?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Investment and finding skilled recruits (the latter particularly for corporates) are the two challenges that crop up the most. When it comes to the former, I&rsquo;ve had conversations with startup founders who have really struggled to find willing investors in the North. Many find that they have to jump on a train to London to have face-to-face conversations with them, such is their reluctance to travel in the opposite direction, whereas others look as far as the US. We&rsquo;re working on two initiates to help with this. The first is a proposed co-investment fund between the public sector and private sector business partners that would make up to &pound;30 million of funding accessible to startups in the region. The second is our Tech North Angel Network programme that aims to encourage more high net-worth individuals (or &lsquo;pre-angels&rsquo;) to become angel investors and invest in tech startups.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What technology are you most interested in at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It would have to be virtual and augmented reality. I was inspired to pick up an Oculus Rift after trying out new business solutions and games developed by Kotori Studios (based in Leeds), New Moon Studios (York) and Slanted theory (Sheffield). VR is incredibly fun and has huge potential in both the consumer and business space, but I think AR and mixed reality is going to have the biggest impact on both. That&rsquo;s mainly because it allows you to operate in your field of vision and see where you&rsquo;re going while wearing the headset, and partly because Apple is pushing the tech. That never hurts!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFollow Kane on&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KaneFulton&quot;&gt;Twitter&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;for more news about Tech North and start-up news across Yorkshire.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWould you like to take part in a Q&amp;A?&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:raj.bains@amsource.io&quot;&gt;Click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-kane-fulton-of-tech-north', 'yes', 'no', 1508803200),

Here he tells us more about his career journey, being a Google Developer Expert and provides some insightful advice to young developers. Read more below...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey, I&rsquo;m Harry. I&rsquo;m a&lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Consultant Front-end Architect and Performance Engineer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;from Leeds. It&rsquo;s a bit of an obscure job title, but primarily I work with large organisations to help them, and their teams, write and manage large-scale websites. My focus in on scalability and performance, ensuring that front-end development projects can grow at a sustainable rate, while also remaining as fast as possible for the end user.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlthough my clients are very much international, Leeds is where I&rsquo;m based. I&rsquo;ve been here for just over nine years now and show no sign of leaving anytime soon; when I&rsquo;m not travelling for work, I can be found booting around West Yorkshire on either of my bikes or eating and drinking everything that this beautiful city can offer me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially sparked your interest in pursuing a career in technology?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;You know, it was a complete accident. I&rsquo;m not from a very technological family at all&mdash;the opposite, in fact! I didn&rsquo;t get internet access at home until I was 15 (2005) and my family all shared the one computer. I started off wanting to be a graphic designer and spent a lot of the time from 15 to 16, along with my then-best friend, Sam, working on logos and flyers and business cards for local businesses. After a good run at that, I decided that we needed a portfolio site to showcase our skills (we had no skills&mdash;looking back on it, the work was pretty weak), and volunteered myself to learn how to write HTML and CSS to build it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Not long after starting that, I realised that not only did I much prefer coding, I was much, much better at it. A series of self-initiated projects later, and I was pretty convinced that this was what I wanted to do full-time. At 17, I began applying for front-end development jobs in Leeds and was picked up by&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyjacobsleeds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Jacobs, the Creative Director&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at now-defunct Sense Internet. It&rsquo;s all gone on from there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have worked with a number of leading tech organisations. What attracts you to a company?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It&rsquo;s a complete mixture of things, but I&rsquo;ll be brutally honest and admit that one of them is vanity: as a self-employed developer, having prominent companies on my client list is a real boon.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nBut, of course, there are plenty of much better reasons. My background is in large-scale product environments&mdash;I spent around three years as a Senior Developer at Sky, in Leeds&mdash;so I have a skill-set that these companies value. I guess I&rsquo;m just a little more naturally inclined to that kind of environment.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso, the problems that these companies face&mdash;famous or otherwise&mdash;present a fascinating challenge for me. The proposition, the pressure, and the obstacles posed are a great chance to tackle something new.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, I guess that if you&rsquo;re working for a well-known company, your work is likely to impact a far higher number of people. It&rsquo;s quite cool to see an advert for Trainline and knowing that I was the person responsible for making that site faster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;re a Google Developer Expert. Can you tell us more about what it means to be a Google Developer Expert and how you got to that level?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I am! It&rsquo;s a great honour.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nA&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/experts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Developer Expert&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is an invited, non-Google developer who Google deem to be outstanding in their field. As well as technical abilities, they look for people who are good ambassadors within the tech community, who share and evangelise.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nTechnically, anyone can get there. If you&rsquo;re a great advocate and work hard to share knowledge in your field (mine is Technology, but the others are Marketing and Product Design), then a Google employee can invite you onto the program. Once they have made the invite, you then have to go through an interview process; first with an external Expert from the relevant area, and later an interview with a member Google staff.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIf you pass those, then you&rsquo;re in! You&rsquo;re a GDE.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/8899794454_6800d9c2d1_z.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You were also named Young Developer of the Year by&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Net Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. That&rsquo;s quite an achievement! What work were you doing at this time to be awarded such recognition?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Hah! I was. That was a few years ago now, but it&rsquo;s true.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAt the time, a lot of things had been happening in my career&mdash;I was beginning to speak at conferences with increasing frequency, I was writing a lot more articles, I was contributing to the open source space, and I&rsquo;d just started working for myself. It was a busy period for me, and I think that gave me prominence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would be your advice to young developers hoping to make an impact in the technology sector?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/927183442130894848&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I tweeted something recently&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;which seems to have resonated with a lot of people&mdash;entering tech now seems a lot more intimidating than it was for me a decade ago!&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMy honest advice would be pace yourself, learn the fundamentals, and focus on integrity and resilience. There are lots and lots of new, shiny, exciting tools available, and more and more are appearing each week. While this does add an element of excitement, it also brings a lot a lot of fickleness, and what I see more and more is an entire generation of developers who&rsquo;re focusing on tools but neglecting the basics. Tooling, languages, and frameworks can be learned relatively quickly, but the fundamentals will never change; optimise for a stable baseline of understanding and then complement that with the specifics as and when you need them. That&rsquo;s a recipe for a much more robust and long-lasting career in tech, in my opinion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;When I was becoming a front-end developer &asymp;10 years ago, knowing \\`border-radius: 5px;\\` made you a rockstar. I do not envy today&rsquo;s beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Harry Roberts (@csswizardry)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/927183442130894848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 5, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You have a large following on social media. How important do you think it is for technology professionals these days to be active on social media and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;For me it&rsquo;s vital&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great form of direct marketing, meaning I can get my message directly in front of those most likely to hire me. It&rsquo;s an essential business tool. I think that a decent command of social media is going to be crucial for anyone wanting to make their way in tech; the social proof alone helps to build trust and credibility. Though not a deal-breaker, I&rsquo;d be hesitant to hire someone for a tech role if they don&rsquo;t show at least some engagement with the tech community.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your focus has mainly been on CSS over the years, but recently your focus has slightly shifted, can you tell us more about this, please?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;CSS is a creative, fun, yet very imperfect language. It grants a lot of creative freedom but also is hard to tame at scale. It&rsquo;s this very fact that allowed me to specialise so heavily in CSS&mdash;I worked on defining and pioneering a lot of the approaches that people across the world use to manage CSS in large applications today. After doing that so intently for so long, I just got ready for a bit of change.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nToward the beginning of 2017, I decided to shift my focus more toward performance engineering&mdash;making websites fast! Performance work is something I&rsquo;ve been involved in for the last five years and was always a vital addition to the front-end development work I&rsquo;d been doing, but I want to make it much more front-and-centre. It&rsquo;s work I find fascinating, rewarding, and newly challenging: you can always produce a faster website; the question is how?&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s also a great way to add lots of value and make plenty of positive impact. Fast websites keep users happier, and they cost companies less to run; they cost users less to visit, and they also earn companies much more money. It&rsquo;s a scenario in which everybody wins.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nA large sub-focus of this has been on the ethical and moral aspects of performance: users in poor-connectivity areas, or regions where data is costly, will genuinely struggle to visit a poorly optimised website. I want to focus on making the same information as accessible to those in rural India as it is in the centre of Leeds.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n(Fun fact: my website takes 1.3 seconds to load from Dublin. In Nepal, it takes closer to a minute. The same site is over 45&times; slower just because of the fact someone is based in a low-connectivity region.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have been based in Leeds for over nine years now! Can you tell us how the technology landscape of the city has changed since you first became a Leeds resident?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I have! I adore this city! Particularly within the last five years, it&rsquo;s become such a bustling and vibrant place to be, tech or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;\nThe tech landscape has changed quite drastically, and fast. When I first moved here, it was a scene dominated by many small agencies, all competing for the same work. The upshot of this was that most companies began competing on price&mdash;&lsquo;we can do it faster, cheaper!&rsquo;&mdash;which in turn led to developers working long hours to fulfil promises made to clients by their managers. This overworking and underpaying (because tech jobs were not very competitive at all here until recently) then led to what I perceived as being quite a deflated and unenthusiastic tech scene: a city of developers who didn&rsquo;t want to go to meetups after a 12-hour day but just wanted to go home.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter my stint in agency-world, I then worked for a tech VC firm around 2009. Weirdly, it was a complete flop. I mean it, nobody came asking for investment! That company was about three years too early for Leeds, which I still feel is a real shame. The entrepreneurial spirit hit Leeds much later than London. If that company had opened its doors in 2012 there&rsquo;d have been people queuing for a shot at funding for their startup.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the last three-to-five years, the influx and rise of product-based companies in Leeds (Sky being the most obvious example) have led to much more attractive salaries, far more enthusiastic and engaged developers, much more exciting project and prospects, and has finally made Leeds a real tech hub as opposed to a client-services city.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMost of the agencies I encountered at the beginning of my time here haven&rsquo;t managed to weather the storm: slowness to respond to changes in the market, reluctance to compensate developers equitably, and sometimes even just lousy management has made way for a much more thriving and active scene. While I do find it sad to an extent, I think the developers in the city have won in the long run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How do you think the tech scene in Leeds compares to other tech hubs in The North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I think the North&rsquo;s main problem is that our cities are always playing second fiddle to London, and therefore don&rsquo;t often compare ourselves to each other, but to the capital. I reckon we could do a lot more to band together and learn from each other, but all too often we&rsquo;re looking South. I do wish I knew more about other cities in the North, but I do know that Newcastle has a fantastic startup and incubator scene, the likes of which we don&rsquo;t currently foster. Manchester has some big players, but I feel like perhaps their focus is more on creative than on tech.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMaybe that&rsquo;s something I should focus on in future: exploring tech in the North as opposed to much further afield&hellip;?&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;2018 is just around the corner. What tech trends would you like to see take off in the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to see less of a focus on zeroes and ones, and more of a focus on ethics, the impact of our work, and the hidden moral obligations we have as designers and developers. I&rsquo;d like to see people pushing back on requests to build software that can be used for harmful purposes. I&rsquo;d like to see teams taking a more proactive stance on things like accessibility and performance, to ensure that the products we&rsquo;re building can be accessed and used by people in different and adverse conditions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nTech is incredibly exciting, but while it&rsquo;s only serving the most affluent and fortunate members of society, it&rsquo;s all for nothing. I&rsquo;d rather see websites that work beautifully on the older phones prevalent in emerging economies than see another &pound;1,000 phone only available to the global top 5% of earners.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What is your favourite tech innovation and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Haha, this is going to be a disappointing answer, but I&rsquo;m not that into gadgets and the &lsquo;new cool&rsquo;. I spend as much time as possible away from tech and gadgets as possible&mdash;I&rsquo;d much rather spend a day with my mountain bike than with my laptop. That said, I did pick up an Echo recently which is quite neat. But then I circle round to my previous answer about ethics: the Echo isn&rsquo;t there to make my life easier; it&rsquo;s there to mine my data and sell things back to me. It&rsquo;s actually quite creepy really.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Do you have any new projects planned for 2018? If so, can you tell us more?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Nothing specific. I have some exciting client engagements lined up, and I do have some ideas for a couple of side projects I&rsquo;d like to (finally!) make a start on, but other than that I just want more of the same. I want to help people understand how they can better serve their users, wherever they may be.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 8, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-web-development-consultant-harry-roberts', 'yes', 'no', 1511481600),

It works by the referee identifying an incident that needs to be reviewed. Video footage is then reviewed by the VAR behind the scenes. Within seconds the VAR can then advise the referee via headset what the footage shows. A decision is then made by the referee to review the footage on the side of the field before taking appropriate action or the referee can chose to accept the information given by the VAR and then take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe VAR tech has been customised and improved over the last two years to meet the specific needs of football and to make sure it embodies what VAR ethos is : &ldquo;To minimum interferences and maximum benefit&rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/blog/hidden-technologies-at-the-2018-fwc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/1.VAR_TECH.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/blog/hidden-technologies-at-the-2018-fwc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(FIFA.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22001774&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Goal-line technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe were first introduced to goal line technology in the 2014 world cup in Brazil.

Developing a primary MVP and supporting a live operational model requires cashflow. Whilst the traditional methods of funding are still available there are a vast array of other sources now such as crowd funding, private funding via high Net Worth individuals, venture capitalists, grants and innovation loans.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Workforce Growth &ndash;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;One of the biggest decisions for any start-up is whether to outsource skills. Both have their benefits but ultimately finding and retaining talent is required and can be a challenge in itself, especially when recruiting for roles you may not be experienced in hiring for. Initiatives such as apprenticeships, training plans, flexible working and job sharing all attract and support the people needed to grow with your company. Finding companies that understand your sector and what talent you need to start to bring resource back in house, will be of great benefit.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Diversity &amp; inclusion &ndash;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Often overlooked in the early years of starting up a business but having a truly diverse and inclusive workplace allows for diverse exchange of opinions and knowledge and will ultimately enrich your company culture and staff engagement.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Company Structure &ndash;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;Just as lack of funding can be an issue, growing too quickly, taking on too many sales / contracts without the correct operational support can equally stunt a company. Taking the time to integrate core project management, development, sales and support processes that can scale with and underpin growth demands are vital for long term success. Without the correct internal processes and structure, businesses can find themselves stuck in a loop of gaining new sales but not retaining repeat business, which are the most profitable.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have recently been shortlisted in&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardladies.com/national-awards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&nbsp;The STEM Rising Star category at the Forward Ladies Awards and Summit&lt;/a&gt;.

(48, 'A Q&amp;A with Jen Talbot, Data Scientist at Intechnica', 0, '', '', '630873a547c38f4dabb7e0713c378874.png', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about yourself...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I have been a Data Scientist at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intechnica.com/&quot;&gt;Intechnica&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;since July 2017. Previously I was an&nbsp;ESPRC Doctoral Prize Fellow&nbsp;at the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intechnica.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in the Computer Science department, researching next-generation non-volatile memory technology. I wrote my PhD thesis on mathematically modelling thermal fluctuations in magnetic storage technology, also at the University of Manchester, graduating in 2015.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially drew you to a career in IT?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I studied physics as an undergraduate and physics and IT have a big overlap. When I went into research I decided I wanted to be researching future computational technology, although I was initially focused on devices and physical hardware. I spent the first year of my PhD building high-tech microscopy equipment and writing the control and analysis software. I ended up building a working model atomic force microscope out of Lego for university outreach demonstrations. I was more drawn to the programming and mathematical modelling side of things though and that became the most successful area of my research. I decided eventually that it wasn&rsquo;t particularly the physics that interested me, but using the analytical skills I had developed, solving problems and working in cutting edge research and technology development, all of which were more than applicable to the IT sector.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What appealed to you about specialising in Data Science?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;A lot of my work in academia involved data analysis and it was something I found both challenging and enjoyable. Towards the end of my PhD I became much more involved in data analysis and writing mathematical models and I discovered that I really enjoyed it. It was a bonus when I discovered that those skills were also very much in demand. I came to Data Science as it was a career that offered me opportunities to use and improve the skills I already had and develop new ones in the same area, while working on things that interested me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like about being a Data Scientist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Analysing and seeing patterns in data I think is the best part of what I do. It&rsquo;s a challenge from start to end, but when I&rsquo;ve got everything together and anyone can look at the visualisation and understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on without any further explanation from me it&rsquo;s really satisfying and I feel like I&rsquo;ve achieved something. I have presented a lot of data to a variety of audiences and there is a real talent in making sure what you&rsquo;re showing is understood quickly by everyone in the room. I&rsquo;m always trying to get better at it too.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your current role sees you as a Data Scientist at Intechnica in Manchester, can you tell us more about Intechnica and what they do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Intechnica are world leading digital performance and scalability experts &ndash; originally known best for providing digital strategy and infrastructure consultancy for eCommerce applications worldwide.&nbsp; However around 18 months ago they release a web traffic insight and management solution based on advanced machine learning, which is where I fit in as a Data Scientist working with our Machine Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe product is called Traffic Defender and ensures websites can serve an unlimited number of customers and blocks out all the nasty traffic on the web.&nbsp; So, you can see it as having two parts, the first protects against peaks in traffic consuming more resources than there are available.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt ensures uptime and prevents sites crashing, and provides a queuing system to let all visitors access the site in a fair manner.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe second is the really clever bit where the data science and machine learning comes in. Businesses are plagued by automated non-human traffic (known as bots) some of this is good (like GoogleBot) however a lot are doing all sorts of nasty things on their site, such as stealing content, price scraping, launching attacks, creating fake accounts to get sign up offers, or trying to brute force crack customer accounts.&nbsp; In the middle, there&rsquo;s a whole set of bots that depending on your business, you may or may not want on your site. Some businesses want them, to promote their product with third party sites, other businesses will regard it as price scraping and content theft.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve built a system that enables businesses to manage their web traffic, identifying what is not human traffic and challenging it. The machine learning enables us to understand the intent of web traffic rather then look at access requests.&nbsp; From here we can provide insight into the nature of traffic, categorise it and provide the customers with their own choice as to whether they want to manage and optimise it, or block it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s a typical day like for you at Intechnica?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I work on both real-time data analytics and retrospective insights into historic data. I don&rsquo;t think I really have typical days and everything moves very quickly. One day I might be putting together an in-depth analysis of web traffic and the behaviour of non-human traffic, pulling out highlights of good and bad bot behaviour and the next I&rsquo;ll be improving our real time behavioural analysis, updating the model to find new behaviours and stop a new type of security threat.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How would you describe the tech scene in Manchester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There is a huge and very lively tech scene in Manchester. Coming from the University of Manchester I was continually exposed to a lot of the start-ups that sprung out of various research topics and a lot of my friends went on to work in tech start-ups &ndash; or in a few cases start their own successful ones. There&rsquo;s a huge amount going on in the tech scene generally though and a lot of meet ups, hackathons and talks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Would top three tips would you give to anyone wanting to pursue a career in data science?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There are a few good online courses for data science &ndash;Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree is good &ndash; and I would absolutely recommend doing a course on Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence for anyone interested in developing their data science skills as both areas of becoming more important to data analysis. I would also encourage anyone looking to pursue data science to make sure they are up to date on the latest technologies that are being used and be constantly on the look-out for opportunities to learn more. Finally, I would say that data science is a pretty broad area and it&rsquo;s not all programming and being comfortable with maths and statistics is a must, knowing what algorithms are doing and how they work beyond will save a lot of time and effort.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s your favourite piece of technology at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Obviously I&rsquo;m really excited about the advances being made in artificial intelligence and neural networks and that&rsquo;s an area I&rsquo;m personally interested in learning more about. I&rsquo;ve being dying to find an excuse to play around with Google&rsquo;s Tensorflow for a project. I also like to keep up to date on advances in biologically inspired computing and I&rsquo;ve read a few exciting research papers recently about using nanoscopic magnetic devices to store data by copying the way neurons behave in the brain.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', 'Jen Talbot', '', 'a-q-a-with-jen-talbot-data-scientist-at-intechnica', 'yes', 'no', 1542758400),

Meetings continue over &lt;a href=&quot;http://amsource.io/edison&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt;, group chats keep the office banter alive and Friday afternoon beers have been replaced with a team pub quiz!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard work is also continuing, of course. While there have been obvious challenges during this initial period of readjustment during lockdown, it hasn&rsquo;t stopped up from doing what we do best - helping tech companies find the best possible talent for their needs. While some businesses have understandably hit pause on recruitment and decided to take stock for the time being, we&rsquo;re noticing those that have continued to recruit are flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the delay to IR35, we&rsquo;ve worked hard getting many of our contractors renewed, with our clients pleased to have the familiarity and reliability of proven talent available to them during a time where flexibility is paramount. Many businesses that had previously turned their back on contracting in favour of permanent hires have also reverted in light of these changes, allowing the contract market to be a hive of activity, which had started to slow in anticipation of IR35 being implemented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our clients looking to hire, grow and scale permanently have also worked with us to completely redesign their recruitment processes to allow for the new rules we have in place. One business, for example, used to operate a five stage face-to-face interview process, with colleagues from around the country having to travel to different sites in order for candidates to meet all of the relevant personnel before a hiring decision was made. In light of the lockdown, that has now&nbsp;become a two stage remote interview process via Edison, with hires already having been made and remotely onboarded, with both client and candidate extremely pleased with how the new process worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, we&rsquo;ve noticed a definite upturn in the number of clients exploring additions again, with the more settled and definite nature of the current situation allowing businesses to plan with more confidence, having seen the lay of the land and been able to more accurately project their health going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amsource will be working remotely for as long as we&rsquo;re required to, and during that time, want to help our clients remotely recruit, interview and onboard as successfully as possible.

Having already attracted 46 mentors from across a wide gamut of disciplines - with more joining all the time - it presents a worthwhile way to give back to a community that has allowed us to have the careers and lives that we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Young people or those new to the sector looking for guidance or start-up advice have no better place to turn for free, meaningful discussion on how to achieve what they want, democratising knowledge and networking in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t have been previously possible. Less than a month in to its journey as a platform, and The Mentoring Club is already attracting plenty of praise and attention, showing the potential to become an invaluable resource as word continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time to get involved with such an innovative group of people, with the opportunity to participate in something so potentially meaningful and beneficial a rare occurrence. Especially at a time like now when so many of us have been removed from normality, it&rsquo;s great to see our community putting measures in place to remain supportive and progressive, which is a credit to those who&rsquo;ve spearheaded the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should you wish to get involved with The Mentoring Club as either a mentor or mentee, we would be more than happy to provide you with an introduction to the platform and get you in touch with the relevant people.

I just wanted to take some time to provide in insight why we&rsquo;ve decided to make such big changes, and how that will hopefully be a mutually beneficial decision.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why have we launched a new brand and website? It&rsquo;s simple, really. Amsource has evolved - and is continuing to - which is why we felt it was time to have a brand that reflected our company and work as it is today and will be going forward, rather than what it may have been in years gone by. We&rsquo;d left our old identity behind some time ago, and wanted to do justice to ourselves and the people we work with by working on our appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that our work growing tech businesses and being an active member of the tech community is something we&rsquo;re extremely proud of, and we wanted to give that much more prominence and visibility going forward. We wanted our brand to reflect not only our business more accurately, but the markets in which we operate as well - it was important that we had the same feeling of belonging in how we presented ourselves to the world as we do inside the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&rsquo;t a traditional transactional recruitment business, and with our unique products such a strength of what we do and what we can offer, it was important to us that we gave them the best foundation possible. The way we can display and discuss the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amsource.io/edison&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://talentsauce.io/&quot;&gt;Talent Sauce&lt;/a&gt; is now far more accurate for products that are deserving of headline status. We&rsquo;re a team who specialise in finding talent solutions, scaling businesses and being an indispensable advisory service - we didn&rsquo;t want our digital footprint to suggest any differently than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As as extension of that, our new website has been designed to provide maximum insight in to who we are and what we do. We want clients and candidates to be aware of how we can help them from having landed on our site, and then talk to us more closely about how we can go about making that happen. We don&rsquo;t want Amsource to feel like a buttoned up corporate environment, because on top of delivering we like to think we&rsquo;re good to work with, too - we&rsquo;re transparent and approachable, so that&rsquo;s what our website needed to be, too.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practically, our blog is a knowledge hub that we aim to share useful, timely pieces through, with the ability to upload CVs, browse the job market and get in contact with us also fundamentals - despite not being the most glamorous to talk about! This isn&rsquo;t about form over function, so all of the tools and resources you&rsquo;d want and expect haven&rsquo;t been neglected.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between these changes, we hope everyone that we currently do business with - and those we hope to do business with in the future - now have a greater understanding of Amsource, with a more honest reflection of who they&rsquo;re working with now readily available to them. We help businesses solve problems by hiring the right talent, rather than simply putting bums in seats - and our new brand and website just further underlines that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look forward to speaking soon,&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Maeer, CEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Amsource proud to unveil new website and branding', '', 'Amsource CEO Andrew Maeer discusses the new company website and branding - including the decision making process behind those changes', 'amsource-proud-to-unveil-new-website-and-branding', 'yes', 'no', 1589328000),

Whilst it&rsquo;s tempting to simply camp out in front of the television and mow through those Netflix shows you&rsquo;ve been meaning to binge, that sustained period away from work will make the transition back to professional life all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst it&rsquo;s unfair - and quite frankly unrealistic - to expect furloughed members of staff to spend their whole days as they would if working from home, there are some measures that you can take to not only better prepare yourself for the return to work, but further your skillset and career in the process&hellip;with plenty of time remaining to get through those boxed sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refresh your training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Refresh Your Training&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Refresh%20Training.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we&rsquo;re at work, we&rsquo;re often so focussed getting our tasks at hand completed that we lose sight of the training we&rsquo;ve received. The foundation to what we&rsquo;re doing, a lot of what we once learnt can be lost in the day-to-day rush of performing our roles, so this break could be a perfect opportunity to revisit those resources and reestablish the fundamentals. At the very least, it&rsquo;s sharpening skills frequently relied on, so there&rsquo;s no harm in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn a brand new skill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_New%20Skill.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech presents us with infinite opportunities. With so many specialities, most people will stick to the field and area in which they feel most comfortable, becoming experts in their preferred language or code, whilst rarely touching on the variations. Businesses value flexible and multi-skilled employees, so by showing both the willingness and ability to learn and master new skills is an excellent method to not only expand your knowledge base, but boost your employability.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update your personal brand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Update%20Personal%20Brand.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may seem frivolous on the surface, but taking some time to keep your CV well organised and up-to-date, as well as ensuring your LinkedIn and other professional social media is well maintained can go a long way. Rival companies are always looking to hire, so even if you&rsquo;re happy in your current role, another opportunity might not be too far around the corner - so putting yourself in the best possible position to impress potential hiring managers with a slick CV and impressive online presence can be the difference between catching somebodies eye and not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reevaluate your career trajectory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Career%20Trajectory.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A far more long-term train of thought, but we are rarely put in a position where we can take a step back from our careers and evaluate the route we&rsquo;re currently on.

While they&rsquo;re essentially designed to serve the same purpose as a face-to-face meeting, they can often be an entirely different experience to a more traditional exchange in person. However, making a good first impression remains imperative, so there are measures and behaviours to make yourself aware of before sitting down to be interviewed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile there may be the possibility of a phone interview being requested, these are rarely formal stages during the recruitment process as hiring managers anymore, and tend to be a precursor to a meeting in person or via video.

Most conferencing software is now compatible with smartphones and tablets &ndash; as well as laptops and desktop computers &ndash; which should have the inbuilt speakers, microphone and camera that you require.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAlways test that these are operational, make dummy calls to people you know to double check that everything is being received well on their end, and this then removes any worry on the day of being undone by a technical mishap, which may reflect poorly on your candidacy if it&rsquo;s clear you&rsquo;ve failed to prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Remote%20Interviewing3.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px; height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take account of appearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only should you make sure you&rsquo;re presentable by dressing professionally and holding yourself in the same formal, polite manner you would in person, but there are additional concerns about your surroundings that should also be taken into account. Ensuring that you&rsquo;ll be situated in a quiet, private area is essential, so that the conversation isn&rsquo;t ever interrupted and both yourself and your prospective employer can hear and be heard as clearly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nYou should also be mindful of what can be seen behind you by the camera &ndash; unmade beds and messy homes should be avoided, so if possible, sitting with your back to a clear wall would be ideal. If that&rsquo;s not achievable, then having a tidy field of view behind you is a must.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Remote%20Interviewing4.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px; height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&rsquo;t discount transferable skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you may not be with your prospective employers in person, they will still be looking to judge your level of enthusiasm and engagement for the position being discussed. In exactly the same way you would for an interview in person, you should speak confidently and clearly, remove any distractions from around you and give your interviewer your complete, unbroken attention.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNot only should you have researched the role and company, but you should have questions prepared to ask back, with the right level of technical preparation done to ensure any competency-based questions can be answered in an appropriately knowledgeable manner.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you currently on the lookout for a new role in the IT and tech industry?

(59, 'Mental Health Awareness Week: 5 Acts Of Kindness To Perform During Lockdown', 0, '', '', '6b54f9ad1e4a4fd39678b1f06091c56f.png', '&lt;p&gt;This year, the theme of Mental Health Awareness Week is kindness. During such a challenging and strange period for us all, being kind to one another has never been more important - a worldwide pandemic is an issue we only combat when working together, building harmony and relying on our communities to help society function as normally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of the amazing work and sacrifice we&rsquo;ve seen shown by our incredible NHS and frontline workers, there have been incredible individual displays of kindness, such as the fundraising effort made by the inspirational Captain Tom.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With more spare time on our hands than ever, many of us are challenging ourselves to be more selfless and kind, and with mental health being tested so robustly during lockdown, there has never been a better time to make that extra effort - to not only benefit others, but boost your own sense of purpose and happiness as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Organise a swap station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple idea that many communities are embracing, swap stations are often left at the end of somebodies driveway in an easily discovered place, so that people out on their daily walks can simply happen upon them. Usually a large box filled with books, board games, CDs or DVDs, the premise is simple - for every item you take, you replace it with another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;This allows people to find new sources of entertainment during these extended periods of home, and facilitating something that is entirely reliant on community involvement provides a sense of belonging and achievement for those who&rsquo;ve taken the time to organise it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Deliver a care package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These don&rsquo;t have to be elaborate, but letting somebody you&rsquo;d usually be spending time with know they&rsquo;re being missed and thought of allows for a degree of intimacy our lives are currently missing. Whether it&rsquo;s a few chocolates and sweets, a face mask or some bubble bath, a little handwritten note or something you&rsquo;ve taken the time to bake, allowing someone to have that moment of surprise on their doorstep will go a long way right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Thinking about others and distracting yourself from any notions of isolation will brighten your day and broaden your horizons. Not only will the recipient feel loved and taken care of, you will have the benefit of knowing you&rsquo;ve done something good and selfless for somebody you care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Reach out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simple? Yes&hellip;but none the less important. In the world of smartphones and Zoom calls that we live in, nothing is stopping you from simply getting on FaceTime to somebody you know might be feeling alone, or organising a quiz with your family and friends one evening to give everybody something to look forward to and feel a part of.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Allowing somebody the chance to talk is hugely important, especially if they&rsquo;re at home alone. A friendly face, a virtual shoulder and kind words will mean a lot, and could be the difference between somebody feeling alone or not. For people you&rsquo;re missing, this is a chance to miss them that little bit less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Support the vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many communities have set up local groups to volunteer within, so you know who needs help with what and where. With so many older people much more vulnerable during times likes these, if you don&rsquo;t have somebody within your immediate family or friendship group requiring assistance, it&rsquo;s highly likely you have a neighbour nearby that does. Helping with shopping and giving them some companionship is one of the most important tasks currently available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Not only will those vulnerable members of society feel looked after and safer during such a worrying time, you will have a renewed sense of purpose and achievement which may be lacking for those who aren&rsquo;t currently working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Get in the kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meals out and takeaways are either completely off limits or increasingly hard to come by, so why not treat those you live with to a nice home cooked meal instead? With more time to try different recipes, you could even split tasks and make a starter, main and desert individually. Staying in is the new going out, after all!&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Cooking is widely recognised as one of the most calming, meditative and fulfilling tasks you can perform. Learning new skills is a huge bonus, but letting your mind focus on something that you can later enjoy the effort from is genuinely gratifying for all involved, not just yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For those struggling with mental health, speaking out in the most important thing to do. It&rsquo;s okay not to be okay.

Make sure you have a conversation about mental health this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/get-involved/time-talk-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time to Talk Day.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDid you know that between 2016 and 2017 that total numbers of people being treated for work related stress, anxiety or depression was 526,000? The total number of working days lost to these types of conditions during this time frame was an astonishing 12.5 million days.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith every job there is bound to be an element of stress involved. But what can be done to limit strain on your health and well being in the workplace? And how do we recognise and support colleagues who may be going through a difficult time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s been reported this week that by encouraging a more open environment we should see a drop in the estimated 300,000 people who leave their jobs annually due to mental health problems, according to the government&rsquo;s Thriving At Work report, and reduce the associated costs to business which stand at &pound;30.3bn per year, &pound;105bn to the UK economy as a whole, according to the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-in-mental-health-applying-all-our-health/wellbeing-in-mental-health-applying-all-our-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Department Of Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith it being Time to Talk day we thought it would be an appropriate time to further explore how as a team at Amsource Technology we can combat and better deal with work related stress and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Open culture...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMore often than not many employees are reluctant or scared to tell their manager about a mental health problem which is when problems tend to spiral further.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA survey carried out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mind&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;revealed that 1 in 5 people felt they couldn&rsquo;t tell their boss if they were overly stressed at work and less than half of people diagnosed with a mental health problem have told their manager.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy setting a clear signal to employees that their mental health matters companies are creating a culture where more people will feel that they are able to come to management with their personal problems in the workplace. Many organisations can back this up with a mental health strategy in place. For example: counselling facilities in place, time allowances for exercise classes, team building exercises with health and wellbeing in mind.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy taking proactive steps to create a more open and supportive culture, over time staff should begin to feel more confident to talk to managers about their mental health.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Recognise the signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAs mentioned before many employees feel that they can&rsquo;t talk to people about their mental health. Even by incorporating an open culture, there may still be some employees who find it difficult to open up. In this instance it&rsquo;s important for employers and fellow colleagues to recognise the signs.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;According to the Mind website, the main things to look out for are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in people&rsquo;s behaviour or mood or how they interact with colleagues&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in their work output, motivation levels and focus&lt;br /&gt;\n-struggling to make decisions, get organised and find solutions to problems&lt;br /&gt;\n-appearing tired, anxious or withdrawn and losing interest in activities and tasks they&lt;br /&gt;\npreviously enjoyed&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in eating habits, appetite and increased smoking and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;If you recognise this in a colleague, what&rsquo;s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTalking to someone about their mental health can be a difficult and uncomfortable one because the person being approached may not want to talk about it. Therefore knowing the best way to approach the situation is essential.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nChose an appropriate place: If the person is a colleague, addressing the conversation out of work premises or out of the presence of other employees is really important.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEncourage them to talk: Let the person know that you have noticed a change in them and that they are welcome to talk to you if they are experiencing any difficulties. By normalising the conversation, it may feel less daunting to approach you in the future about this. Ask simple, open and non-judgemental questions and let people explain in their own words how their mental health problem manifests, the triggers, how it impacts on their work and what support they need.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon&rsquo;t assume: In these situations it&rsquo;s really important not to make assumptions. Don&rsquo;t guess what a colleagues symptoms may be and why they may be feeling the way they are and how it might affect their job. Many people are able to manage their mental health and perform their role to a high standard but may require support measures when experiencing a difficult period.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEnsure confidentiality: For the majority of people with mental health problems they find it extremely difficult to open up about what they are experiencing. The last thing they want is to feel like everyone knows their problems and that people are talking about them. Confidentiality is essential and the person in question needs to have the upmost trust in you that what is spoken about is not then going to be repeated. Remember people may not always be ready to talk straight away so it&rsquo;s important you outline what support is available, tell them your door is always open and let them know you&rsquo;ll make sure they get the support they need.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Find more tips on the Mind Website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/workplace/mental-health-at-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe hear about it a lot in the media, but the main step to combating mental health issue&rsquo;s is to lose the stigma, especially in the workplace.

Alongside health and fitness other popular resolutions tend to be career orientated with many people setting their sights on securing the job of their dreams, getting that promotion, pay rise or being all round happier at work in 2020.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, in order to achieve these career goals, more ground-work and preparation needs to be put in place as opposed to getting yourself to the gym or eating more vegetables.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this blog we&rsquo;ll be providing some key points that should feature in your targets for the year ahead to help you live your best working life in 2020 and help you meet those career goals!&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a track of targets and monitor them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/aSZSj0mT8f6tW&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a note of the goals you want to meet. Create short-term, smaller goals that are going to help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set yourself daily, weekly and monthly targets. Once you are able to see that you are meeting your smaller targets this will increase your confidence throughout the year as you will be able to visualise and see your success. Also &ndash; if you are behind on a target or weren&rsquo;t able to meet one of your smaller milestones you will be more aware and likely to make a conscious effort to stay on top of it in future. It will help you see patterns and recognise where improvements in your approach need to be made.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis monitoring will help you also organise yourself and prioritise your time which will also enable you to meet your goals, but also limit the stress that is sometimes associated with managing your time and working to different deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere are some great apps you can use to help you track your goals and stay on track.

Users of LinkedIn often share advice with their network as well as other useful information and blogs.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHiring managers and recruiters also share news about upcoming positions, so it&rsquo;s a great way to hear about exciting new roles hot off the press.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBeing active on LinkedIn and connecting with the right people is a great way to raise your profile in your industry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com&quot;&gt;Set up or update your profile today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Attend more industry events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/3o7qDEq2bMbcbPRQ2c&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attending more industry events will not only build your knowledge on a range of subjects in your area but will also connect you with other people in your industry. Events are a great place to meet people and build connections who may connect you to new roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking at events is also another way to get noticed and build your career. If you are particularly knowledgeable about an area of your industry, why not share this with a wider audience? Event organisers are always on the lookout for guest speakers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s easy to find out what events are happening when on websites such as Eventbrite, Meet-up and social media sites like Twitter and LinkedIn.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/111ebonMs90YLu&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&rsquo;re looking for a new role in the new year and take part in interviews it&rsquo;s really important to ask for feedback if you weren&rsquo;t successful in the process. By asking for feedback you&rsquo;re able to correct mistakes and build your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&rsquo;t looking for a new role but are keen to progress in your current role it&rsquo;s important to ask your manager about your performance and what it is you need to work on in order to get to the next stage in your career. By asking about this, it will not only show commitment to your role but also will enable you to incorporate this feedback into your targets so you are clear in what you are working towards and what you need to achieve to get there.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Try to take more risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/zOuMplFlHPPoI&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try something new in 2020 and step out of your comfort zone. Albert Einstein famously described insanity as &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are not where you would like to be in your career, you need to be prepared to change things, try something new and step out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals!&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'New Year&#039;s resolution', '', 'new-year-s-resolutions-live-your-best-work-life-in-2020-', 'yes', 'no', 1577836800),

Whether through a simple tweet, post on Instagram or a status update on Facebook, we can instantly be made aware of aware of different issues around the world than we ever were before.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAn example of when social media has been a great tool in raising awareness was in the summer of 2014. Unless you we&rsquo;re living under a rock at that time, you will be familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alsassociation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#ALSicebucketchallenge&lt;/a&gt; that took social media by storm. This involved &nbsp;social media users making videos of themselves throwing buckets of ice cold water over each other or themselves and nominating their friends to do the same whilst also donating money to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alsa.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALS Charity (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS6ysDFTbLU&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe campaign played a huge role in helping the association raise $115 million. As of August 2014, it had resulted in 1.2 million related &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/alsassociation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; videos and 2.2 million Twitter mentions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Ice Bucket Challenge &quot;was possibly the most successful social media fundraising and awareness effort I&#039;ve ever seen,&quot; says Mike Koehler, president, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smirknewmedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&ldquo;Smirk New Media&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks in no small part to a lot of celebrity involvement, the campaign achieved pure viral &quot;magic,&quot; according to Koehler.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://millennialceo.com/social-media/social-media-changed-communicate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;COMMUNICATION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media and networking have broken the barriers when it comes to communicating and we are spoilt for choice when it comes to ways of getting in contact with someone.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nToday, if you can&rsquo;t reach someone on the phone, you can leave a voice mail or send a text. Or even better, tweet, Facebook message, or touch base in other ways. We have the ability to see what others are doing, often within seconds of them doing it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media search functions also make it easier if we want to track someone down who we are looking for or may have lost touch with. There are seemingly endless sources we can search to access the information we need.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-tell-stories-with-facebook-and-instagram-carousel-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TELL YOUR STORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given everybody who chooses to sign up to a platform, the opportunitiy to tell &#039;their story&#039; online. Whether that is through Facebook, Instagram pictures, Tumblr blogs. Normal people now have the capacity to make their opinion known on a massive scale.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://returnonnow.com/2014/09/how-social-media-has-changed-us-the-good-and-the-bad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;It is far easier to do something remarkable, noticeable and have it reach people across the planet than it had at any other time in history.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn turn this has created a whole new category of &#039;fame&#039; and &#039;celebrity&#039; - Social media famous. Every day social media users have the capacity to gain worldwide fame and impressive fortune simply by logging and posting their content. Take beauty vlogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoella.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zoe Sugg ( also known as &#039;Zoella&#039;&lt;/a&gt;) for example, Zoe has gained worldwide fame and popularity through uploading helpful beauty blogs on to social media site Youtube. Since opening her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, Zoella has gained an impressive 6.5 million followers world wide (and growing) and has earnt an estimated &pound;3.5 million fortune. Just proving the impact social media can have on everyday people.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTx0haEjHok&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/ca/stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Snapchat&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; &#039;Story&#039; function allows users to share a series of 10 second videos that can be posted to the user&#039;s story for 24 hours. Giving snap chatters the opportunity to share a timeline of videos throughout their day, and film important events as and when they happen. Brands are using it as a way to connect with customers, and celebrities are using it as a way to connect with fans and to give their followers an insider&#039;s look at what goes on in their everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SHARE YOUR OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given everyday people the ability to have a voice that can reach millions of people. Before social media was such a big element in our lives, you could have an opinion, or a view on something and only really your close knit group of friends or family would know about it. But given how easy social media makes it to reach other people, more people are using social media as an outlet to vent, and share their thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile this can be a great tool (as we&#039;ve highlighted above) with raising awareness for worthy causes or sharing important news with your network. Many social media users have found themselves in extremely hot water when it comes to sharing an opinion online that may not be a welcome opinon, or a view that might have the capacity to offend people. For instance people have found themselves fired from positions, or on the face of news publications for over sharing, or making comments on issues that &nbsp;has caused mass offense. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5?IR=T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;IF YOUR NOT PAYING FOR IT, YOU&#039;RE THE PRODUCT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFacebook for example embodies this philosophy and has created a whole empire from it. Astonishingly this is no secret, and we as users still willingly hand over our details and personal information.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRecent research reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; states that most young people are more than willing to hand over information. 91% of users share publicly accessible photos of themselves, 71% post where they live and share their location when updating posts, 61 % of users give their email address away and over a fifth share their mobile number.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know more about strangers than ever before. Years ago personal moments in your life were only shared with your close family and friends, these days that is still true but is also shared with our 500+ network of followers and &#039;friends&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-for-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BUSINESSES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given companies a chance to have a voice when it comes to their brand and a different way to connect and engage with their customers as well as their employees.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial networks enable businesses across the world to amplify their message in a way never thought possible only a decade or two ago.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBusinesses can now respond to customer queries and complaints in real time, with the ability to converse and engage with their customers on a different level which is continually improving as social media companies&rsquo; progress. This in turn is creating a better sense of customer service and brand loyalty among followers.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has proved to be an invaluable tool for businesses who want to grow and connect with their audience.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/dealing-with-disaster-how-social-media-is-helping-save-the-world-1203809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RESPONSE RATES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe speed of social media has changed the way we learn about and respond to natural disasters. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/01/20/social-media-lessons-haiti/#lQaUkbDj1OkB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;After a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti, non-profits used social media to mobilize &lt;/a&gt;rescue efforts and to support the community. This also saw the deployment of one of the most successful text-to-donate campaigns seen at the time. Similarly, when earthquake and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8379101/Japan-earthquake-how-Twitter-and-Facebook-helped.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tsunami rocked Japan in March 2011&lt;/a&gt;, millions of people around the globe used social media to search for family and friends, as well as get updates on a situation that was very frightening at the time.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore recently back in April 2015 after the disaster of the Nepal earthquake Facebook reacted quickly by activating a function that allowed those in the vicinity of the disaster to &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/04/26/global-social-media-lifeline-in-nepal-earthquake-aftermath/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mark themselves as &lsquo;safe&rsquo; on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; so that their friends and loved ones we&rsquo;re able to see. Years ago, it was more difficult after a natural disaster such as an earthquake for families and friends to located potentially lost family members, social media has been able to bridge where there was a gap there.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;POLITICS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Watching the returns at 9:45pm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElectionNight?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ElectionNight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MAGA?src=hash&quot;&gt;#MAGA&lt;/a&gt;???????? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HfuJeRZbod&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HfuJeRZbod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Donald J.

At the last election in 2012 there was still a presence especially with candidates using Twitter and Facebook and Youtube. But this year, it was clear to see that the presidential candidates were using social media and it&#039;s influence as a key driver in their campaigns. Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump used Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and pretty much any other social media outlet to influence voters.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-37942842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New methods of prediction&lt;/a&gt; based on data from social media were also used to predict the final results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brandseye.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrandsEye&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that looks at people&#039;s tweets, correctly predicted both the vote to leave the EU in June&#039;s referendum and a Trump victory in the US election, but how did it do this?&nbsp;The company took a sample of 200,000 tweets. These tweets were then checked by a crowd-sourced army logging in from their homes. Their task was simple; when presented with a tweet, decide if it was pro-Trump or pro-Clinton. As this method was proven successful, and accurate, it&#039;s probable that social media will continue to be used to predict results like these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;RECRUITMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has also changed the way in which we as recruiters operate.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLooking back to 10 years ago, recruiters were limited in the ways they could reach out and engage with potential candidates and clients, but thanks to the rise of the internet and mobile devices paired with the growth of social media, it would seem modern day recruiters are now spoilt for choice in the ways they can make contact with potential candidates and clients.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Search:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media outlets have search functionality that allows recruiters to search for people with a particular skills set, job title or people within a particular region. Opening rich talent pools filled with new candidates ready to move into a new role.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt also enables recruiters to search for their clients and stay on top of what they&rsquo;re are up to and engage with the content they may be sharing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; We&#039;ve mentioned about staying up to date on content shared by clients. But social media also gives recruitment agencies the &nbsp;opportunity to share their own thoughts, opinions and expertise to a wider audience through social media channels. Those recruiters that do this may be able to add credibility to their service and set themselves apart &nbsp;from &#039;cowboy&#039; recruiters who can give the industry a bad reputation.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Candidate job searches:&lt;/strong&gt; Content shared by recruiters are often job adverts. An increasing number of candidates are using social media as an outlet to search for jobs. Which makes it a great environment to advertise for roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW HAS SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACTED YOUR LIFE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this blog we have shared just some of the countless ways Social Media has impacted the world we live in.

Job satisfaction will be high as you will become a key part in guiding candidates through the interview process and offering important advice to help them to secure their dream role.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/5kFyAIX8LvZW0CSgg6&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2. WORK WITH GREAT, TALENTED PROFESSIONALS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI enjoy working with the IT industry because I deal with professionals that care about their careers and where they want to go, and that speak passionately about what they do&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;3. WORK WITH GREAT ORGANISATIONS AND COOL BRANDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe get to work with some great companies. Everyone will look for different things in an organisation, but I like to think we&rsquo;ve got it well-covered across our major client base. We work with award-winning companies, companies that use all the latest and coolest technologies, companies that compare their working environment to Silicon Valley organisations like Facebook or Apple, cool start-ups, and well-established companies that will add some very notable projects to candidates&#039; CVs.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;4. LEARN ABOUT A SPECIFIC MARKET, BECOME AN EXPERT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAt amsource we work with some very talented professionals who know their stuff, and by specialising in one sector of IT we can ensure that we know our stuff too and appear credible when talking about our own individual markets. By developing an expertise in a market, we are able to provide much more of a specialist approach for the IT industry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;272&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/Is1O1TWV0LEJi&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;5. WORK ALONGSIDE A HI-TECH INDUSTRY WHERE YOUR EXPERTISE IS TRULY VALUED.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe work with hi-tech, forward-thinking companies that develop cutting-edge technologies and candidates are grateful to have the opportunity to work with these companies. As experts in our respective markets, we have a proven history of offering advice and guidance in recruitment and our specialist knowledge and advice is valued by clients and candidates alike.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;6. &ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S IN IT FOR ME?&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHard work doesn&rsquo;t go unrecognised. Besides the monetary rewards, we have incentives in place on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis to continually motivate us, such as lunch, nights out, and holidays. And we get a say in what our incentives should be too!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;7. REAP THE FINANCIAL REWARDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMoney is one of many reasons why people turn to a career in recruitment, which is why recruitment agencies look for people that are money motivated. Recruitment is very process-driven and if you follow the right processes then you will begin to make frequent placements and see the commission come in.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/mg2Xa0af44fFm&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;8. MEET PEOPLE LIKE YOU.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBecause there is no real clear-cut path into recruitment, you will meet people from all walks of life. At amsource we have Consultants that have graduated in Philosophy, Drama, and Sports Science, but none of that is important as we recruit for the right people. It&rsquo;s important that you demonstrate the core attributes of a recruitment consultant: confidence, tenacity and target-driven to name a few, which means you can guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be surrounded by like-minded individuals, encouraging a great working environment.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;9. FAST-TRACK YOUR CAREER PROGRESSION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nDue to the nature of the business, in order to succeed in recruitment, you have to be ambitious by nature. Ambitious people want to progress and excel their careers, which is often what propels people into a career in recruitment as it will give you the opportunity to fast-track your career and take it in the direction that you want.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;10. FEEL EMPOWERED!&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWorking as a Recruitment Consultant is like owning your own business. We offer a very supportive environment and great training, but how quickly you progress and how successful you become is ultimately up to you.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/111ebonMs90YLu&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere at Amsource Tech, we are always on the look out for hard working people with a &#039;make it happen&#039; attitude to join our growing talented team.

I have a background in Technical Pre-Sales and I have been asked a lot recently, how you can move from an Infrastructure Support focused role, into a Pre-Sales Consultant position. I started my career as a 1st line analyst moving up to 2nd and then 3rd line before moving into Pre-Sales. The key to becoming a successful pre-sales consultant is being able to interact with people both personally and professionally.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Pre-Sales consultant is initially involved to provide the bridge between the Sales professional within your organisation and the end customer who is often a tech-focused IT manager or Architect. You need to be able to work with your Sales team to deliver the best sales pitch, ultimately, they deal with the numbers and you deal with the solution, time frame and customer objectives. Your role is to provide the technical knowledge to these negotiations, offering different solutions for a problem that fit the clients budget and overall objective.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What initially attracted you to pursuing a career in the digital/IT sector?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I have always loved technology, which started at school. The digital sector was always a booming market and the constant changes in technology allow you to constantly upgrade your knowledge.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What&rsquo;s an average day like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;My role is twofold, Pre-Sales consultancy and post-agreement installations. As mentioned, I bridge the gap between our sales team and the end client to agree a solution, a time frame and the objective of each installation or service. Once signed on the dotted line, I then provide the bridge between the customer and our installation team providing technical knowledge internally and managing expectations externally.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What&rsquo;s your favourite part of the job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;When an install or project is completed and the solution is in place which meets the client&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do you face on day to day basis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Often the client can come into the install discussions with expectations that cannot be delivered, the challenge is to set the clients expectations on budget capabilities, time frames and solutions prior to the install taking place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do you think are most prevalent in the digital sector at the moment and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The most prevalent challenge is often keeping up with the latest technologies and choosing wisely on the type of technology a company you work for supports. If you join a company that requires legacy support, you will soon find that your skills are outdated and limit your opportunities in the future. My advice would be to join a forward-thinking, tech-driven organisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;How has or how will BREXIT impact your role (if at all)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Difficult to forecast, but I do think it would have an impact as some clients I have supported in the past have been European based. Will tech companies relocate their HQ&rsquo;s?! I&rsquo;m not sure at this stage, only time will tell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;As an IT professional, what attracts you to working for an organisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;An ethical, client-driven organisation who is excited by new technology.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What top three tips would you give to someone beginning their career within IT/Pre-Sales?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Concentrate on developing yourself personally. It&#039;s great if an employer will send you on external sources, but you need to be committed to financing certain courses yourself. It will benefit you in the long run&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPass and share your knowledge with your colleagues, ask for advice.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nExpect to fail but learn from that failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', '', '', 'how-to-make-a-career-move-into-it-pre-sales-', 'yes', 'no', 1578355200);

So here are some reasons why I think you should choose a career in software testing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SOFTWARE TESTING OFFERS A ROUTE FOR PROGRESSION&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s rewarding for many reasons, one of these being because you choose where you want to go. There are various types of testing that you can choose to specialise in, whether that&rsquo;s manual testing, automation testing, performance testing, or a combination of these. Within these, you might find that you really enjoy database testing, or web testing, or GUI testing, etc. &ndash; the list goes on. You may choose to move into more of a leadership role from there on and go down the management route, or you may decide that you&rsquo;re keen to develop yourself technically and expand on your knowledge of hands-on testing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhichever route you choose, there are courses and accreditation&#039;s that will help you in these areas and the roles are clearly defined.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;THE FIELD OF SOFTWARE TESTING IS EVOLVING, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN BE AS TECHNICAL AS YOU WANT TO BE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOur clients look for Testers from all walks of life, but the demand is ever-increasing for Testers that can code and fulfill roles like Automation Tester, Developer in Test, Performance Tester, Penetration/Security Tester, etc. Picking up a new language and improving on your technical skills is a great achievement, whether that&rsquo;s .Net, Java or SQL.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SOFTWARE TESTERS ARE VALUABLE IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAnd what&rsquo;s more rewarding than adding value? Testers are crucial to the development of software. They vet the software for defects, which Developers often miss as they don&rsquo;t have the same eye for detail, and they ensure that the software meets the business and technical requirements. Our clients recognise just how important Testers are and are heavily investing in their test teams, whether that&rsquo;s providing Automation training or helping towards the costs of testing certifications.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nYou will get your hands on Selenium, Cucumber, and other test tools that are all the rage at the moment. We work with companies that apply the best Agile test processes to testing, that develop cloud-based software, and that make the best efforts to continually improve their testing and test processes with the latest technologies and techniques.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;WHY WOULDN&#039;T YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe recruit for testing roles at all levels at Amsource&nbsp;with specialist Consultants that cover permanent and contract vacancies.

Assisting people to widen their connections, learn from their peers and trailblazing companies and offer environments to forge collaborations is vital.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLeeds also have some brilliant initiatives in promoting and nurturing STEM subjects and courses at primary, secondary and higher education; from summer schools, placements, gap-years, workplace outreach and apprenticeships.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGvOS0HnNpQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Deb Hetherington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/deb%20hetherington.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDeb&rsquo;s work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Leeds Beckett University&lt;/a&gt; impacts the digital sector in the North in a range of ways, from sizeable knowledge transfer partnerships with large scale projects, right through to working with digital start-up companies offering the full spectrum of university services.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDeb&rsquo;s main project is a European funded programme &lt;a href=&quot;https://ad-venture.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called Ad:venture&lt;/a&gt;, which offers digital start-up companies assistance in marketing, business planning, app development, mentoring, workshops, funding and more. Deb is able to meet with companies interested in the programme and run through a full diagnostic of their business in order to gauge where they are now, where they are aiming to be, and what their barriers to growth are. She can then create a business support programme for them made up of the services listed above.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere&rsquo;s what Deb has to say about the exciting digital landscape in The North at the moment &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;The digital sector in the North is a really exciting place to be at the moment, particularly in Leeds. There is so much going on, and the best part is how collaborative we are as a city &ndash; with such collaboration and partnership potential the opportunities are endless. It&rsquo;s also great to see so many female leaders in tech here, people who are flying the flag for diversity and are equally bloody good at their jobs; Zandra Moore CEO of Panintelligence, Natasha Sayce-Zelem head of tech at Sky, Tanja Lichtensteiger Engineering Manager of Sky Bet to name but a few. There is a strong network of women in tech in the North, who also provide mentorship for young women coming through education who want to work in digital. Educating the next generation is hugely important in order to maintain our position on the digital map and retain the talent our university&rsquo;s are churning out.&ldquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kicking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leedsbeckett?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@leedsbeckett&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/digitalshiftsummit18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#digitalshiftsummit18&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HalifaxUBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HalifaxUBC&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ribbitmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ribbitmedia&lt;/a&gt; talking about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ADVENTURE_LCR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ADVENTURE_LCR&lt;/a&gt; journey.

The idea stemmed from Anna&rsquo;s frustration at getting insight from data within the organisations she was was working for. Anna and Ed discussed and decided they wanted to build a product that could help non-technical people process and analyse their own data sources. Their determination to be self-funded meant they had to find money from somewhere and so the consultancy was born!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere&rsquo;s what she has to say about running her own business and being a female leader, &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day running your own business. Learning to lead &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; in a totally new industry has been an immense challenge (particularly juggling alongside motherhood). Most fulfilling has been building a brilliant team and making sure we have an environment that lets us all thrive.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnna is active in the Leeds Digital community and can often be found speaking at regular local events including Ladies of Code and was recently on the Panel of the Leeds event of the Tech Nation tour.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Natasha Sayce-Zelem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Natasha%20Sayce-Zelem.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/natashazelem-634b369/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natasha Sayce-Zelem&lt;/a&gt; is Head of Technology at Sky and has been named one of the UK&rsquo;s Top 100 Women working in technology right now.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNatasha is also the founder of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/technology-event-in-leeds-will-encourage-more-women-to-take-up-careers-in-stem-1-9376132&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Empowering Women with Science and Tech&lt;/a&gt; movement in Leeds.&nbsp; The movement is working to showcase inspiring role models working in Science, digital and Technology, in a way to support and attract more women in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjgajBOjDyE&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Tanja Lichtensteiger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Tanja%20Lichtensteiger.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/a-q-and-a-with-tanja-lichtensteiger-of-sky-betting-and-gaming-81865940311&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tanja&lt;/a&gt; is Engineering Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skybetcareers.com/about-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sky Betting and Gaming&lt;/a&gt; in Leeds.

We have demonstrated that, not only do we have a validated system for tracking diet, but also that this can lead to better health outcomes for patients and is supported by health care professionals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'northern tech female tech leaders', '', '21-female-tech-leaders-flying-the-flag-for-northern-tech-', 'yes', 'no', 1546300800),

Things that were in comprehendible twenty years ago are now considered the norm and a part of our everyday life.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs our exposure to digital enhancements increases there is growing scepticism in society about how much of a good thing all this new technology is, and suggestions that this &lsquo;friend&rsquo; in technology we&rsquo;ve welcomed into our lives is actually our foe.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know about the benefits of technology. We know we&rsquo;re better connected, we know healthcare has improved, and we can see that the world feels like a &lsquo;smaller&rsquo; place because of advances in transport tech, among so many other things.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;So what&rsquo;s the cause for concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve wrote blogs in the past about suggestions that technology is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/is-technology-dumbing-us-down--52372516102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lsquo;dumbing us down&rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and that we are more reliant on technology to do things for us rather than taking the time to find the answer ourselves (which we would have done years before). In other words it&rsquo;s making us lazy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere&rsquo;s fears about the negative effect this &lsquo;over exposure to technology&rsquo; is having on our children. In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/digital-education-for-or-against--53384104451&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; we discussed how many Silicon Valley parents are now opting to send their children to schools where there is little or no technology with reports that children who attend schools with a heavy influence of technology do not perform as well as those children who are exposed to a more traditional (tech-free) style of learning.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere&rsquo;s the issue of automation. How advances in technology has the potential cause an increase in unemployment in the future as technology is developed to carry out the tasks a human worker would. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/the-rise-of-automation-to-cause-an-increase-in-unemployment--62727105030&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNot to mention the concerns that as our global population continues to rise, technology advancements will put considerable pressure on our resources and economy, which could cause a domino effect of issues.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhich leads us to ask&hellip;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Can technology really deliver a sustainable future for planet earth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; We recently attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://10bn.sheffield.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheffield festival of 10 billion&lt;/a&gt;, held at The University of Sheffield (15th &ndash; 18th February 2016).&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHow will we live in a world of 10 billion?

The debate also looked to explore the issues that flow from our technological relations and how we can manage them in alternate ways in a world of 10bn.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27208569&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Our demand for energy - and the life enhancing technologies it powers - has led to the plundering of the earth&#039;s hydrocarbons oil, gas and coal, ultimately leading to potentially catastrophic climate change.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;The key question leading the debate was &lsquo;if technology got us into this mess can we trust it to get us out?&rsquo; &hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was really interesting to hear the various views surrounding these topics. The prime take away for us was that yes technology will be an important element in sustaining our planet as our population grows to 10 billion however, investment into development of green technology will be key as climate change continues to be a pressing issue.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies are still reluctant to see the value of turning green.

At the moment approximately 15% of CO2 emissions come from cars alone.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMany attendees asked can we trust the technologists to help us in this quest for sustainability in what seems to be such a profit hungry market?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;d love to get your views on this as well.

At the start, it all felt like a nice simple project, Antony has always bought vintage items as a trader and asked for my help in building a website for him so that he could cover more of the country. What we didn&rsquo;t know is that within 3 years we&rsquo;d be filling 34,000 sq ft building and launching in the Netherlands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It&rsquo;s fair to say the journey has been incredibly &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_155 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;155&quot; id=&quot;155&quot;&gt;eye opening&lt;/g&gt; for us as founders. Along the way we&rsquo;ve hit the usual milestones for start-ups, such as getting our first 1,000 customers, soon followed by 1,000 Trustpilot reviews, generating our first &pound;100k in revenue, and then reaching our first million, but it hasn&rsquo;t all been rosy! Hiring before focussing on efficiencies inflated our overheads and like a lot of start-ups we almost ran out of money, but we&rsquo;ve learned invaluable lessons along the way, and being around the right people is where we&rsquo;ve learned the most.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/4_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have secured funding from &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_158 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;158&quot; id=&quot;158&quot;&gt;Dutch&lt;/g&gt; Founders Fund, which also includes VC Airbridge and some other very successful Dutch entrepreneurs. What have these partnerships enabled you to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;re fortunate enough to have a team that includes the Co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.just-eat.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Just Eat&lt;/a&gt; and Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.treatwell.co.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_156 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;156&quot; id=&quot;156&quot;&gt;Treatwell&lt;/g&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; Laurens Groenendijk, the Founder of SpaceBuzz Foundation, Hidde Hoogcarspel, the Founder and CEO of SoConnect, Daan Donders, and the Founder of WeTransfer, Bas Beerens, as well as three others who all have a role in supporting us. Their motivation, enthusiasm and vision &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_159 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;159&quot; id=&quot;159&quot;&gt;has&lt;/g&gt; been the real catalyst to our growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;One of the biggest impacts has been for us to start seeing things bigger. They have instilled a far greater sense of what is possible with Vintage Cash Cow and we meet with the team regularly to discuss next steps, which helped us maintain focus on what will really make a difference.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With their support, we&rsquo;ve just launched a new B2C site in the Netherlands and our brand-new fundraising brand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintagegiving.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VintageGiving.com&lt;/a&gt;, is now live. We&rsquo;re also in talks with two of the top five Dutch charities to help build them white label versions of the VintageGiving platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/1_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why have you chosen to grow your business here in Leeds?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antony has always lived here, just north of Chapel Allerton, and when deciding where to have the warehouse, it had to be in the city centre. Now that we&rsquo;ve been hiring digital and tech roles, we&rsquo;ve really seen the benefit to being located here and we&rsquo;re looking forward to doing more to collaborate with the tech community here in Leeds, with the expectation of more growth team hires throughout the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;With our growth into the Netherlands, another nice bonus is Leeds Bradford airport - we are door-to-door with our investors in Amsterdam in around three hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mention that the tech community is an attractive aspect to being based in Leeds, how do you as a business engage with the tech community in Leeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engaging with the tech community in Leeds is very important to us. In previous years, we&rsquo;d used mostly Dutch freelancers as we were unable to commit to &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;163&quot; id=&quot;163&quot;&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_161 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;161&quot; id=&quot;161&quot;&gt;full&lt;/g&gt; time&lt;/g&gt; in-house positions, but we&rsquo;re in a very different position now. We&rsquo;re now &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_162 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;162&quot; id=&quot;162&quot;&gt;focussed&lt;/g&gt; on creating more tech and digital jobs in Leeds this year, which will not only benefit the tech ecosystem here in Leeds but it will also be central to enabling our business to scale and grow as we progress with our roadmap of expansion into the Netherlands, Germany, and with the large charity deals that we have brewing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re currently in talks with one of the coding competitions at Leeds Digital Festival for sponsorship, which will be a great opportunity to showcase our product, growth and hiring roadmap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/2_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you use Technology to drive your business? And why is Technology important to your business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The backbone of our operation is the CRM platform that we&rsquo;ve built over the last 3 years. With a few adjustments, we&rsquo;re now using it to manage a retail focussed service for 380 Age UK stores. Last week we replicated the platform, made a few more changes and it&rsquo;s now ready for the Netherlands.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We rely on technology to handle each lead, from cradle to grave, with triggered emails, SMS messages, phone calls and letters. Our appraisals tool allows us to store the customer journey of each box that gets sent it, its contents, and the appraised price. With our launch into the Netherlands, it means that the team will be able to easily get second opinions from our core team of senior experts in the UK on higher value boxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;To sell in the volumes we do, we&#039;ve built our own selling platform. Currently, it publishes the items onto eBay, but soon it will also list on other marketplaces too. eBay isn&#039;t designed for high volume sellers where every item is unique, so we built our own way of doing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;While the team has grown from 7 to 12 in the last year, the revenue that the department produces each month has grown by over 300%, so internal communication and visibility over what&rsquo;s happening &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_130 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;130&quot; id=&quot;130&quot;&gt;is&lt;/g&gt; vital. We push data from various sources to create focussed dashboards for each team and ensure that everyone&rsquo;s working together to reach targets.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/3_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a champion for Tech4Good, what initiatives do you have planned for 2019 related to this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;re in talks with a number of big charities to white label our service - taking all our learnings from the last 3 years and creating for them, their very own version of what we do. We handle everything for them, the customer service, handling boxes, the buying and the selling.&nbsp;The charity has a new site to promote as a fundraising tool - especially helpful for ones that do not have retail outlets to accept goods and sell them on.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Our &quot;Vintech&quot; approach to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_140 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;140&quot; id=&quot;140&quot;&gt;re-commerce&lt;/g&gt;&lt;em&gt; is scooping up millions of pounds worth of old and unused vintage items. We don&#039;t target the people who sell on eBay; instead, our ads attract the people who are time-poor and want rid. The stuff we buy would have sat in homes for decades to come. Its next destination would likely be a landfill but instead, people are turning their old stuff into a few quid to spend, helping towards the bills or a treat for themselves, and ensuring there is zero waste.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve received and sold on vast amounts of vintage items to fuel the second-hand marketplace. We give people far more second-hand buying options on eBay so they buy less brand new items. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;In the last year, we&#039;ve sold:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2.8 tonnes of costume jewellery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2,000 old clocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4,000 fountain pens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;40,000 watches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;7,000 cameras&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;25 tonnes of scrap metal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and so much other stuff!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We provide a Circular economy; whilst 10 different peoples&#039; broken pocket watches aren&#039;t much use on their own, we amalgamate these job lots and sell them on to worldwide traders, helping them with their needs for old spares and repairs parts. In the last year, we&#039;ve sold to people in over 80 countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;re providing charity shops with a new revenue stream - once they&#039;ve tried to sell an item in their store, they then box it up to sell to us. Age UK uses us in all 380 shops, and we&#039;re working with 15 hospices and an additional 150 charity shops so far.&nbsp; We collect boxes of items from their shops free of charges and within 48 hours, we&#039;ve posted them out a cheque.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We learned that some charity shop managers let local traders pay 5p per kilo for the non-precious scrap metals they receive such as brass, copper, pewter and silver plate.&nbsp; We promise to pay them well in excess of &pound;1 per kilo for most non-precious metals, a huge increase for them, helping them to make more money. We also help&nbsp;charities raise money from the &quot;unsalables&quot;, which some shops aren&rsquo;t allowed to sell. These include military weapons, furs, smoking pipes, razors, wine and champagne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve now got the green light to start work on a white-label solution with one of the world&#039;s largest charities, currently operating in over 190 countries. We&#039;re building them their own branded version of our service, powered by our charity brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintagegiving.com/&quot;&gt;Vintage Giving&lt;/a&gt;. It would otherwise be far too costly for this charity to raise donations via supporters vintage items, but we&#039;ve now made it possible and we&#039;re excited to see what 2019 will bring!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/david_anthony_vcc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vintage Cash Cow &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_114 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;114&quot; id=&quot;114&quot;&gt;have&lt;/g&gt; been shortlisted at the 2019 Leeds Digital Festival Awards (taking place on 30th April at Headrow House) in the Growth Company of the Year category.

The platform revolutionising the Tuition world. Here, founders Mark and Scott tell us more about how they got their idea off of the ground, challenges they have faced, achievements and plans for the future. Read more below...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First off here&#039;s little bit about the founders...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.linkedin.com/in/scott-woodley-495010bb&quot;&gt;Scott Woodley: COO &amp; Co-Founder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nScott began his career in Sheffield and graduated from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;with a Masters in Law. From here, Scott went on to become a primary school teacher, and after a period of consideration left to become a private tutor. Being greatly oversubscribed in that role, he came up with the idea for Tutorful to provide a trusted network of local tutors.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-hughes-91b2601b/ &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Hughes: CEO &amp; Co-Founder&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHaving studied Structural Engineering at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, Mark went on the spend several years as a Technology Analyst in the finance industry working for a large investment firm in Edinburgh. Mark taught himself to code in his spare time, which became a great asset during the early days of founding Tutorful.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What initially sparked the idea to start the Tutorful venture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Tutorful started in response to problems that Scott faced in his role as a Primary school teacher and then as a tutor. It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that schools are feeling the pressure of substantial austerity cuts, increased class sizes and tumultuous changes to the curriculum, at a time where the future job market is sizing up to be unpredictable and hugely competitive. The effects of which are felt on teachers and students alike.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a teacher Scott was asked by many parents to recommend a private tutor, wanting to ensure that their children were given the best opportunities to succeed. It was difficult to be able to recommend tutors that were reliable, local, qualified, and that weren&rsquo;t oversubscribed. Eventually leaving his teaching role to become a tutor, these issues were something that Scott continued to struggle with. Being inundated with requests for help resulted in Scott establishing a network of local tutors - the early days of what would become Tutorful.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith a high tuition workload and struggling to take more students on, Scott was able to refer that work to other tutors trusted tutors in his local network. With Mark&rsquo;s input the idea snowballed, and they started the process of building Tutorful, an online marketplace connecting parents with tutors. Parents could browse and review the profiles of top-quality tutors, who were specialists at teaching their individual subject areas, at the relevant level and were of close geographical proximity to their students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us more about Tutorful, what it does and who it is aimed at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Tutorful connects parents across the UK with the very best private tutors for their children, bringing transparency to an industry that has previously lacked in trust, openness, clarity and security.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe operate as a marketplace that helps parents to find the best local tutors for one-to-one tuition, either face to face, or via our innovative online classroom. With over 10,000 tutors covering 300+ subjects, and catering for early years all the way up to PhD level, site users can freely browse and review profiles of top-quality tutors based on subject area, level and proximity to their post code.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor tutors, Tutorful provides an opportunity to advance their private tuition businesses. Tutors no longer need to rely on ads in the Yellow Pages or signs in shop windows - Tutorful helps them to create detailed and beautiful profiles showcasing their qualifications, subject expertise, academic history and personality, which are advertised to thousands of potential students every week. The platform then supports Tutors to manage communication with potential students, arrange locations and times to meet, and then handles all payment transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Being a growing start-up business, what challenges have you encountered so far and how have you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Going from a 2 person startup, to company that now employs 30 members of staff is not without its challenges. The biggest identifiable challenge to starting Tutorful has been facilitating the successful scale up. Scaling up and increasing growth rests fundamentally on the ability to communicate those aspirations to an ever increasing team, and effectively prioritise interdepartmentally.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was a challenge to move on from only having to consider a very small number of roles within the company, to setting up departments with niche specialisms. Our rapid and sustained growth has meant we had to rethink the way our team worked, and subsequently systems were implemented that gave ownership and responsibility to the departments.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You were one of the proud winners at last year&rsquo;s Northern Stars Grand Final. How did you find the Northern Stars process? And how has it helped the growth of Tutorful so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Northern Stars was a fantastic competition to be involved in and we were delighted to be named as one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/northern-stars-grand-final-2017-73252111512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;top 10 startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe process itself was hugely enjoyable, from meeting local founders during the regional finals to having the opportunity to introduce the business to a large new audience. During the events which have followed, we&#039;ve gained further press coverage and had lots of opportunities to learn from new connections made.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a founder, the most enjoyable and useful result is getting to know other founders, who you can turn to discuss shared problems. We&#039;ve been fortunate enough to get guidance on hiring and marketing, as well as being able to share what we learn about building a happy, successful team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErtNFkIkEwA&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What would your advice be to other start-up businesses looking to get their business off the ground?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Prioritisation of resources and where to place your focus is key at the initial startup phase and continues once you move into growth. As a new business owner there will always be a million and one things you could be doing or thinking about, so setting out a clear roadmap for the business and prioritising where your energy goes is super important. This also allows you to iterate rapidly on new ideas or initiatives which have the potential to scale upwards without getting bogged down with details or becoming overencumbered with too much at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What do you think are the biggest barriers are in terms of growth for start-ups at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;From our experience growing Tutorful, we&rsquo;ve personally experienced a couple of barriers for startup growth that can be a real struggle to overcome. First is the intense saturation of new businesses across so many industries. Consumers are spoilt for choice like never before so the challenge here is in building brand loyalty and giving consumers a fantastic reason to keep coming back, rather than switching around between whoever&rsquo;s offering them the best opportunity in that given moment. Those startups who solve the challenge of customer churn and keeping their retention rates high are sure to see improved, and faster, rates of growth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe second hurdle is the lure of the capital. So many of the big-tech companies and up-and-comers are based in and around London, meaning the lion&#039;s share of tech-talent and investment opportunity naturally gravitates there too. This is one we&rsquo;re still figuring out, but something we&rsquo;re definitely seeing is a growing sense of loyalty to the North and the burgeoning tech scene here from everyone involved in its development.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;re based in Sheffield. What is it about Sheffield that makes it a great destination for tech start-ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Sheffield is a fantastic city for all sorts of startups, not just those operating within the tech sector. There&rsquo;s a flourishing entrepreneurial scene here supported by a host of great local businesses, two brilliant universities and networks like Sheffield Digital and Startup Weekend. Being in close proximity to Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle also connects Sheffield directly with other northern startup hubs, with easy access to their networks and talent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What would you have liked to achieve by the end of 2018 at Tutorful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;ve got ambitious plans for the remainder of 2018! Alongside maintaining our fantastic growth trajectory, we&rsquo;re releasing our first mobile apps, designed to help our tutors manage their lesson bookings, schedules and earnings more easily.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re also working on enhancing our online tuition offering. There are huge benefits to moving traditional face-to-face services like tuition into a digital format - reduced operating costs and zero travel for tutors, instant access to learning materials like past papers and video content, and of course the ability for students to review recordings of their sessions to aid with revision. As digital transformation evolves, we&rsquo;re making sure to be at the forefront of its place in the tuition industry over the coming years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFollow more of the Tutorful journey over at their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TutorfulGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter page here&lt;/a&gt;.

With the Java Developers being highly sought after, organisations are willing to &ldquo;pay out&rdquo; for outstanding developers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen thinking about what you can do with Java there are a few common things that come up. application servers, web applications, mobile and desktop application, enterprise applications and cloud-based applications.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can find these in any company using java but I wanted to take a look into some other ways it is currently being used.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;We Have Lift Off..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/6yWV529bDk3WU&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNasa are always creating interesting new products and are using Java for a number of Java for some interesting applications.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTheir World Wind product uses Java,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Wind&lt;/a&gt; allows users to zoom in form outer space and examine any locations.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nJava has also been used to develop NASA mission software, that has been used in various Space missions.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dude, where&rsquo;s my car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/j6cvcVqIpekW4&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSelf-driving cars are becoming more of a reality.

(75, 'Becoming a Future Proof Developer...', 0, '', '', '1d8e1a8b0fda664990e1c8fb295ab9f2.png', '&lt;h2&gt;In this blog our digital specialist David highlights some of the languages he thinks will enable developers to &quot;future proof&quot; their skill set in coming years...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technical landscape is changing, gone are the days of companies just choosing between traditional programming languages such as Java, C# and PHP. These languages still play a fundamental role in Software Development but now we are seeing an emergence of different programming languages, frameworks and technologies that are disrupting the industry. This article will you show what the emerging languages are so you can stay ahead of the trend. There will be languages that I have missed as I could have gone on forever, however I am open to hearing what languages should be on here and your reasons why. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso known as Golang, Go was 2016&rsquo;s programming language of the year according to the Tiobe index. It was created back in 2009 by three google employees &ndash; Rob Greismere, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Go creators say &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of statically typed, compiled language&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLeading tech teams and renowned companies such as the BBC, eBay, Facebook, Netflix and the award winning Gov.uk site all use Golang.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Google Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Producing maintainable code&lt;/strong&gt; - Standardised formatting and naming through tooling (gofmt, lint) and minimalistic language makes it easy to read and reason.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; - Go uses coroutines called goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Communication between goroutines is done very elegantly using channels.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt also offers excellent Performance and Scalability.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe name Scala is an acronym for &lsquo;Scalable Language&rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nScala has been established for a little longer than some of the other up and coming emerging languages with its initial release in 2004.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe creator of Scala Martin Odersky developed the language because he was frustrated with some of the restrictions of Java.&lt;br /&gt;\nHe went on to say &ldquo;Scala was designed to show that a fusion of functional and object-oriented programming is possible and practical. That&rsquo;s still its primary role.&rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBecause of this big tech giants are choosing Scala with it been used for development by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/gb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwir6pvHhcXVAhVLte0KHaGKBk0YABAAGgJkZw&amp;ohost=www.google.co.uk&amp;cid=CAASEuRoe4cTqHaP1IM4ICRQ5TK1Fg&amp;sig=AOD64_3HXuZY_p8OB7EuilgxyhHXGN-mGg&amp;q=&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMxpfHhcXVAhUiK8AKHejWC7oQ0QwIJw&amp;adurl=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Scala?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen describing the benefits of Scala it is easiest to compare it to Java (Scala is sometimes referred to as Java&rsquo;s cousin).&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s functional: The elimination of mutation from application code allows the application to be run in parallel across hosts and cores without any deadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Better concurrency model&lt;/strong&gt; - Scala has an Actor model that is said to be better than Java&#039;s model of locks on a thread.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concise code -&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Scala code is more concise than its more verbose cousin, Java.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Type safety/static typing &lt;/strong&gt;- Scala does type checking at compile time.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/strong&gt; - The case statements in Scala are super powerful.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance&lt;/strong&gt; - The mixing traits are great, and they definitely reduce code repetition.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Domain-specific language (DSL)&lt;/strong&gt; - Scala syntax allows for a programmer to write a natural looking DSL. This ability was carefully built into the original language design. This is a very powerful feature of Scala. Scala test/specs build on top of this feature.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nLaunched in 2009, Clojure is another dialect of Lisp programming language.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe creator Rich Hickey described Clojure as &ldquo;Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic &ndash; every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.&rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is successfully used in industry by renowned companies including Walmart, Puppet labs, Amazon and Salesforce to name a few.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Clojure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concurrency -&lt;/strong&gt; It offers immutable data structures, functional programming with zero side-effects, Software Transaction Memory built in, etc. You can focus your engineering efforts on features instead of concurrency details.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLazy data structures are built-in - you can focus more on writing uncomplicated code than on performance tuning and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;\nQuicker Development - the interactive REPL makes development quicker and more fun. It also dramatically speeds up the learning process.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nRust was created by Mozilla, Rust 1.0 was released in 2014, having been in development for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nClose in some respects to C and C++, Mozilla describes it as a &ldquo;new programming language which focuses on performance, parallelisation, and memory safety&rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo design and implement a safe, concurrent, practical systems language.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRust exists because other languages at this level of abstraction and efficiency are unsatisfactory. In particular:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There is too little attention paid to safety.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They have poor concurrency support.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There is a lack of practical affordances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They offer limited control over resources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rust exists as an alternative that provides both efficient code and a comfortable level of abstraction, while improving on all four of these points.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Stack Overflow survey released recently found Rust to be the most beloved among developers of all programming languages and frameworks.&lt;br /&gt;\nRust is used by companies such as Chef, Samsung and Dropbox.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Rust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTesting: Built in support for testing saves you time and brings consistency.&lt;br /&gt;\nMaintenance: Most of the issues that crop up once the code is shipped such as invalid index, dangling pointer, memory corruption and resource leak. Rust eliminates almost all of these, and more. So in most cases the bugs you would need to fix would be related to actual business logic.&lt;br /&gt;\nSpeed: The goal of Rust is to be as fast as C++. While not quite there yet, it is close&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nKotlin v1.0 was released in February 2016 by JetBrains, the maker of the world&rsquo;s best IDEs.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe head of JetBrains Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compile time of Scala as an obvious deficiency. One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java.&lt;br /&gt;\nWith Kotlin, JetBrains fixes most of the annoyances of Java, while keeps complete compatibility with its parent language (kotlin can interact with java code and vice-versa).. Basically, you can view Kotlin as Java, that doesn&#039;t suffer from NullPointerExceptions and Checked Exceptions, has better generics and refined syntax that heavily relies on type inference, so you don&#039;t have to manually point type info in the most of cases. Also, it has lot of modern niceties like extension functions, first-class functions, (simple) operator overloading and quite a few more cool things that make life of every developer easier.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies using Kotlin include Uber, Pinterest and Atlassian.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Kotlin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nImproves productivity - by reducing the effort needed to write code. For example, a 50 lines (approx.) code written in Java can be reduced to 2/3 (approx.) lines in Kotlin.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Quick code compilation -&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Reduces learning time for developers by providing documentation and support.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Syntax is easy to understand&lt;/strong&gt; - so the code review is simple even for a newcomer.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Runtime overhead is low&lt;/strong&gt; as the standard library is small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe next suggestions are not languages, they are Javascript related tools and technologies. These are becoming more and more sought after as the &ldquo;full-stack Developer&rdquo; is becoming the norm.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js is a runtime system for creating (mostly) server-side applications. It&#039;s best known as a popular means for JavaScript coders to build real-time Web APIs. JavaScript has historically been used for client-side so this is why Node is different.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js has become one of the foundational elements of the &quot;JavaScript everywhere&quot; paradigm allowing web application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in 2009 Dahl was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr. The browser did not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the Web server. Dahl desired an easier way&lt;br /&gt;\nDahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies including PayPal and even NASA are using Node.js in production.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous&lt;/strong&gt; - It&#039;s built to handle asynchronous I/O from the ground up and is a good match to a lot of common web- and network-development problems. &nbsp;In addition to fast JavaScript execution, the real magic behind Node.js is called the Event Loop. To scale to large volumes of clients, all I/O intensive operations in Node.js are performed asynchronously.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt; - Node.js is Javascript. &nbsp;So the same language can be used on the backend and frontend. &nbsp; This means it breaks down the boundaries between front- and back-end development.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Community Driven&lt;/strong&gt; - In addition to its innate capabilities, Node.js has a thriving open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications. One of the most famous is Socket.io, a module to manage persistent connections between client and server, enabling the server to push real-time updates to clients.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOne thing we can take away from this is that a lot of the new languages are created with the aim of removing the annoyances from established programming languages. At the moment if you had no development experience and were to ask what language would I recommend you should learn I would still recommend learning at least one of the mainstream programming languages (Java, C#, PHP, Ruby etc). However we are increasingly seeing some of these languages adopted within companies in the area. Some of the big players in the North of England are developing in Golang, Scala and Kotlin with many more likely to follow suit.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhat are your thoughts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmsourceTech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tweet us @AmsourceTech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'future proof developer', '', 'becoming-a-future-proof-developer-', 'yes', 'no', 1546300800);

(76, 'Top Software Testing Trends for 2016', 0, '', '', 'ec25bd57054a77cf248a6071f9f27f8b.png', '&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s been a busy start to 2016 and we have already seen a lot of movement in technology. As the demand for a more &ldquo;technical&rdquo; Tester increases, so does the importance for a Tester to keep an eye on trends in technology as this will undoubtedly have an impact on expectations for Testers to up-skill in certain areas in order to stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere is what I think will be the most important trends for Software Testers in 2016.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Automation Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTest Automation has advanced significantly in recent years with the availability of popular opensource tools like Selenium Webdriver and SoapUI, providing an opportunity for Testers to create robust and efficient test frameworks. This will undoubtedly continue to grow in 2016, as I predict that companies will begin to see Test Automation as a necessity rather than a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Mobile Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this digital age, companies have had no option but to embrace the rise of mobile technology. This, along with the on-going birth of digital agencies and the uprising of software houses specialising in mobile technologies, means that we will notice a significant impact on software testing as the demand for functional, performance, usability and compatibility testing on these mobile applications increase. We are already seeing an increase in demand for specialist Mobile Application Testers, and as we know, the natural progression for manual methods of testing can only lead to Test Automation, which means we will ultimately see mobile automation as an ensuing trend. Testers can expect to see an increase in demand for skills in mobile automation tools, such as Appium. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;3. More Agile, More Dev-Ops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe increasing adoption of an Agile approach has brought Developers and Testers together and has seen more and more organisations embracing Dev-ops practices in order to speed up deliverables. Testers in 2016 can expect to see testing in an Agile environment as a continuous trend and testing in a Dev-ops environment as an emerging trend.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;4. Big Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBig data is one of many buzzwords in technology right now, slowly rising in popularity over the last few years as companies realise the benefit of analysing complex sets of data to discover information that could help them to make better decisions. If you shop on Amazon, you will have noticed that your buying patterns and previous searches on their website will influence their product suggestions for you on your next visit. Data testing is already quite a niche skill set and an area where there&rsquo;s a skills gap in testing, and as this trend peaks and more companies buy into the hype, Testers will be expected to pick up specialist skills in testing big data solutions. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis is just what I think but I&rsquo;d love to hear others&rsquo;opinions. What do you think will influence the testing community this year?

(78, 'Three Ways To Maintain Company Culture Whilst Working Remotely', 0, '', '', '4b15ba8fdf525daa0ff9a07361f24512.png', '&lt;p&gt;Culture and atmosphere are central to the success of any business. While they may be intangible factors, there is little doubting just how much impact the happiness and fulfilment of a workforce can have on results and group wins.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With so many companies and industries as a whole now forced to work remotely, how does a business go about maintaining that culture while their employees are no longer under the same roof? With so much hard work and time having gone in to developing and instilling the core tenants of these shared philosophies, does that all get forgotten when the constant contact that reinforces it is removed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having worked with many fully-remote businesses, both before and during the current Covid-19 pandemic, there are measures that can be taken to keep that familiarity and rapport alive, to make the eventual transition back in to our normal working lives and environments that bit easier.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create group oppertunities for employees to get together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Get%20Together.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your usual working day included frequent team progress meetings, they shouldn&rsquo;t be forgotten about while working remotely - sharing updates on how your day has been or what you&rsquo;ve got planned can open up regular avenues of conversation and collaboration, which can reinforce that group mentality and help teams feel less apart. Away from purely work focused exchanges, if you&rsquo;re the type of social company who enjoy regular Friday drinks or have a lunch club set up, try and replace that with an interactive online activity to get everyone enjoying themselves together again - here at Amsource, for example, our Friday beers have been replaced with a Friday quiz via Edison, with the whole team participating!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help your employees feel as comfortable WFH as possible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Work%20From%20Home.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same small details that make all the difference in the office are just as important - if not even more so - when working remotely. You should ensure that your employees not only have the right tools to perform their role to the best of their abilities to their disposal, but are comfortable using them at home. In the office, we ensure we have the right desks, chairs, monitor positions, ergonomic keyboards and mice - that same attention to detail should remain for remote employees, especially during such an extended period away from the office. Another touch to consider is company branded merchandise to make them feel a sense of belonging from home - mouse mats, stationary and hoodies are a great place to start.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage communication, and celebrate successes together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Encourage%20Communication.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most offices will actively encourage colleagues to speak about work as often as possible - discussing ongoing tasks, seeking wider views and opinions, informal exchanges about challenges and obstacles. Having that support system to hand is one of the hardest things to replace and replicate in a remote environment. In order to combat this, teams should be equipped with as much communication software as possible, with instant messaging and video calls far more attractive than emails or picking up the phone. When one of the team has a win, this should be celebrated by all as it would be in the office, to reinforce a sense of togetherness and collective success.Need any help with setting your team up remotely?&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to continue recruiting but unsure of how to scale your business in a fully remote manner?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amsource.io/contact-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with Amsource to find out more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Three Ways To Maintain Company Culture Whilst Working Remotely', '', 'How to adapt your company dynamic during the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure your company culture remains whilst working remotely', 'three-ways-to-maintain-company-culture-whilst-working-remotely', 'yes', 'no', 1591747200),

For those businesses who want to reintroduce the office environment into their regular working pattern, here are some essential steps to consider where employee safety is concerned.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&rsquo;t rush back to being fully office based&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s more than one reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t rush straight back in to being fully office based, and both are as legitimate as the other. Firstly, with safety in mind, having a defined split between when the office is opened and when it isn&rsquo;t reduces the chance of transmission should the virus find itself inside your staff bubble. Additionally, based on statistics taken from an industry wide survey conducted by Amsource, the overwhelming sentiment within the industry is that a permanent adoption of some form of remote working should be under real consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit numbers in communal areas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kitchens, toilets, meeting rooms &ndash; any and all confined spaces should have clearly defined capacities established, and ideally a one in one out policy in place. Being in close proximity to others vastly heightens the likelihood of transmission, so these encounters should be completely avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restrict congestion with one-way systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than having people come and go from the main office area as they please &ndash; which is fine under normal circumstances &ndash; if possible, set up a dedicated door that can be used as an entry point and another to exit, defining which direction people should move through the office to avoid loitering and crowding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide sanitiser and promote hygiene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of regular hand washing and good general hygiene, providing staff with hand sanitiser at all entrances and exits - as well as their own bottle on their desk &ndash; allows them to combat any bacteria they may have on their hands at regular intervals. This kind of preventative and proactive measure will make staff feel safer and cared for, which will ease their transition back into the office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take employees individual circumstances into account&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not every employee may be able to commit to coming back into the office at this stage, and that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if they have a valid reason to remain remote. Those who have underlying illnesses, have family at home they&rsquo;re caring for or don&rsquo;t want to risk exposing vulnerable members of their family to the virus inadvertently should all have their concerns heard and understood. Childcare is also a concern for the parents amongst your staff, and with schools remaining closed, that may be another telling factor.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ready to change your businesses mindset from surviving to thriving?

This has been, by far, the busiest decade of my life both personally and professionally, and to see this company go from strength-to-strength in those years fills me with an immense amount of pride and gratitude - to my colleagues, employees, clients, candidates, peers and family who&rsquo;ve all helped in their own way to get us to where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started AMsource Technology - as we were once known! - a decade ago, having just turned 30, yet to get married and with no kids. Ten years on, as a newly minted 40 year old, married and with two amazing daughters, it isn&rsquo;t just my personal circumstances that have changed and grown for the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started, as all fledgling recruitment businesses tend to, as a bums-on-seats transactionally focussed company, working with as many corporate clients as possible to generate revenue and grow the business in whatever way we could. While the service and expertise we offered was good and better than most, there wasn&rsquo;t anything revolutionary or special about who we were, what we did or how we went about doing it. Giving the business better focus and a more defined identity has been the real success of this first decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amsource is now a truly international company, working not just in our heartland of Leeds, but in Europe and America too, with a firm base set up in Berlin that&rsquo;s growing by the day. We&rsquo;ve moved away from some of our more corporate clients and work in the cutting edge start-up space, offering bespoke and innovative Edison and Talent Sauce product-lead talent solutions, rather than simply looking to make as many placements as possible. As our own knowledge and team has grown, so has our reputation and the advisory services we&rsquo;re able to offer, and I&rsquo;m proud that so many of our clients continue to work with us because of the relationships we&rsquo;ve formed, as well as the unicorn talent we help them identity and attract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our tenth year has thrown us its own challenges, but I&rsquo;m proud to have seen those through with the strongest team Amsource has ever assembled beside me. Having moved to bigger offices in a prime location in the centre of Leeds, we have the infrastructure in place to continue on the upwards trajectory we&rsquo;ve set ourselves on, with the ambition as strong now as it was on day one. The first ten years of running this business has been an incredible experience, affording me friends, memories and professional growth that I wouldn&rsquo;t have had otherwise, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where the next decade takes us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all of your continued support, and I&rsquo;ll check back in when I&rsquo;m 50&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, Happy 10th Birthday Amsource!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Maeer,&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Founder &amp; CEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Amsource Celebrates 10th Birthday', '', 'Amsource founder and CEO Andrew Maeer discussed a decade of being in business as Amsource', 'amsource-celebrates-10th-birthday', 'yes', 'no', 1593475200),

It&rsquo;s no secret that from March to May, that pulse was decidedly faint &ndash; but that is, thankfully, no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tech industry was far from being alone in erring on the side of caution, and while we navigated such unchartered waters, that was an entirely understandable mindset. Hiring wasn&rsquo;t completely frozen &ndash; companies that were already working in a fully remote capacity continued to attract talent &ndash; but for the most part, attention had shifted from creating jobs to retaining them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It now feels that, finally, the tide is beginning to turn. While the threat of Covid-19 remains a very real and present danger which should still be approached with complete caution and diligence, as an industry, tech has now settled in to working patterns that allows us to reengage with our ambition whilst adhering to the new public health guidelines. June provided the spark we were in desperate need of, and it was brilliant to see the collective enthusiasm return on the back of that taste of normality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a business, it marked our most successful June in the 10-year history of Amsource, which is a real signal of how positive the mindset within the market has become. Rewarded for the hard work we put in, we&nbsp;were&nbsp;proud to finish the month with a 100% fill rate across all of our vacancies, with a ratio of one hire for every two CVs we submitted. Matched with the partnership agreements in place to use our Edison Key Hire product, the full, efficient service we were able to provide our clients is something our team should be extremely proud of themselves for delivering, having received lots of positive feedback to further underline their performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrying that momentum forward, we&rsquo;re still seeing those same levels of hunger within the market from the most exciting, ambitious businesses. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s still likely that many highly talented people will be let go in the near future as the furlough scheme experiences significant change &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t appear that they will remain on the market for very long, with many of our clients having already brought forward planned recruitment to provide new opportunities to those facing displacement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;re looking forward to helping the industry continue to flourish in the face of adversity, with the increased prevalence interviewing, onboarding and working remotely central to that success. If you are a candidate seeking a new opportunity or a business wanting to land the perfect person to expand your team, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to celebrate such positivity after what was a long and challenging time, and long may the industry and market remain this active and prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Robinson and Mike Dwyer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practice Lead, Amsource&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Why June Was Such A Positive Month Within the Tech Industry', '', 'Looking at how the technology industry is recovering post Covid-19, and the market behaviour underlining that positivity', 'why-june-was-such-a-positive-month-within-the-tech-industry', 'yes', 'no', 1594339200),

A large proportion of our clients have their own recruitment resources internally, but know that without supplementary services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By allowing your internal recruitment department to work alongside Amsource, businesses open themselves up to not only better and more efficient results, but an additional knowledge bank and advisory resource. Our experience of the tech industry allows us to not only provide the best talent solutions and tools available on the market, but we can also discuss strategy and planning to help plot the best course to future success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happily, our reputation and contacts within the market allow us access to the best possible candidates in the industry, providing us the ability to place unicorn talent within your business at far shorter lead times than you would be able to achieve alone. As an additional dedicated resource, we can also help manage applications and interviews to ensure that you&rsquo;re only ever presented with the best possible options for your team, saving you time and energy that could be spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to work hand-in-hand with internal departments, and enhance the job they&rsquo;re able to do, rather than take their role away from them, or become a duplicate resource.

What was it about the Leeds Digital Festival Awards that initially made you want to get involved?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eve: I think the Awards are a really important opportunity to highlight some of the amazing businesses and individuals that we&rsquo;ve got in the Digital sector across the city and the region. We need to take a moment to celebrate and identify them because it provides a real boost to those individuals and organizations to be recognized in this way as well, and to receive acknowledgment of what they have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Do you think the main value of the Awards is to shine a spotlight on those businesses and individuals that deserve a bit of a boost? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: I think I would say that&rsquo;s the primary value, but there&rsquo;s also a secondary value &ndash; which is that it&rsquo;s a really fantastic way to show the rest of the North what we&rsquo;ve got here in Leeds and also to give those individuals a bit of a platform outside of the city. If they&rsquo;re in the process of growing their business and are looking to get more exposure for themselves, it can help trading. I think it&rsquo;s really helpful from that perspective as well so there&rsquo;s definitely two dimensions to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: With so many big tech businesses in the city, tech is quite a large part of the local economy now isn&rsquo;t it? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes the tech sector is really important to Leeds. As a council we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work to support the digital sector over the past 4/5 years in particular, and what I would say is that this is even more important now than it was before Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The digital sector has probably been impacted much less than the rest of the economy and in fact has probably been presented with quite a lot of opportunities. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not entirely universal but compared to other sectors, the digital sector is definitely getting through this much stronger and I can see how there&rsquo;s lots of opportunities for the digital sector coming forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we&rsquo;ve seen across the broader economy is sectors like manufacturing adopting digital technologies that they haven&rsquo;t done before because they&rsquo;ve had to innovate, and I think that presents great opportunities for some of our entrepreneurs and our businesses of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: You mentioned then that over the past 4/5 years the council have done more to support tech as a sector, what exactly have those initiatives been?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: So we do a range of things. We&rsquo;ve been sponsors of the Leeds Digital Festival since it started and we&rsquo;re really proud to support the Digital Festival and see how that&rsquo;s grown over the years. We think that the Digital Festival alone has been an incredible success for the city in terms of helping amplify what&rsquo;s already going on in the city and it&rsquo;s a fabulous collaborative event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&rsquo;ve also invested in supporting networks like FinTech North. Also, before FinTech North came about, we helped with the mapping of FinTech. We&rsquo;ve worked with a number of partners to get a similar initiative off the ground on Legal Tech which is underway at the moment.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve also provided support to North Invest as they&rsquo;ve got going, in terms of providing access to more funding for entrepreneurs in the digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&rsquo;s a whole range of things really. We do tend to support some of the networks promoting diversity in tech like empowering women in tech and the women of Leeds Digital as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Is one of the advantages perhaps that the council maybe looking to show prospective businesses that might be looking at Leeds to come and base themselves that this is a place that has a thriving tech community as well? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes absolutely. The piece of work we&rsquo;re doing at the moment on FinTech mapping and the work we&rsquo;re now doing on Legal Tech is absolutely about that. It has multiple aims of bringing together stakeholders across the city to make sure that they understand just how fantastic the assets are that we have collectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also provides a way to present to prospective inward investors this is a great place to bring your business. The announcement that Iwoca made about opening their second office in Leeds that was informed by information that we were able to provide as a consequence of that FinTech mapping to show the collective potential of Leeds as a destination for that business. So absolutely there is an inward investment angle to some of the work we do as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: In your opinion, why should people submit nominations for the Leeds Digital Festival Awards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: I think it&rsquo;s a great way to put forward an individual or organization that you think do brilliant things and to give them a boost. Particularly now businesses have just gone through a patch of Covid-19 response where someone has been working incredibly hard or a business has really shone through in terms of how they&rsquo;ve pivoted in response to Covid-19 and they&rsquo;re a kind of upcoming business in the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Do you think given the ongoing success in tech in the face of adversity is enough reason to hold the Awards? and underline that we still have things to celebrate and be positive about despite the challenges of this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes absolutely I would agree with that, and there is much for us to feel optimistic about in the city. This is a great way of us showcasing some of the areas where we can still do a lot together as a region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are going to have our challenges in terms of the economy, but I think the tech and digital sector has a big role to play in terms of the momentum that the sector has, and how the sector can play it&rsquo;s role in supporting the city and the region during this recovery. This is a brilliant way to build further momentum and show where those stars are in our tech and digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: As a Leeds Digital Festival Awards judge, what do you look out for? What&rsquo;s in your judging criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: What will I be looking out for? I think I&rsquo;ll be looking out for good ideas, so I like to see business that have got really good products and services that are great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&rsquo;ll also be looking out for leadership and how people are either leading the way in terms of their business or individually, and showing how we can have really forward thinking businesses. I like to look at how businesses operate, whether that&rsquo;s around addressing diversity &ndash; either diversity of thought or diversity of talent. I also like to ask how are some of these businesses collaborating with one another to really make a difference and drive forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: That was a really good catch up, thank you again for taking the time to speak to us! &nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: It was my pleasure, and thank you Amsource for sponsoring the Awards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rescheduled Leeds Digital Festival Awards will now be held on the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September, with the final format yet to be confirmed.

Our aim is to be seen as industry leaders in the Leeds tech scene, and winning the award has definitely helped to boost that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the Leeds City Region tech sector do you think deserves celebration?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, we have seen significant commercial investment within the Leeds City Region. It is fantastic that Developers and other organisations recognise Leeds as being a hub for investment. Numerous organisations have now confirmed that they will be solely based in Leeds, such as Channel 4, HMRC, and SkyBet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has your business been throughout the Covid-19 pandemic?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an organisation that solely runs on SAAS Technology, we were able to seamlessly transition to a remote working model early on in March. We recognised that it is important for us to contribute to the Leeds tech community by taking advantage of this ease of transition so that we could put less pressure on the local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a Google Cloud Premier Partner, we have been following a &ldquo;Serve Not Sell&rdquo; mantra. We have been helping our customers transition to this new remote way of working and Support accordingly during their transition. Moving forwards, we are working with new organisations to ascertain areas within their business where Google Technology can help improve efficiencies, cost optimisations and aid with supporting the new normal we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do you think your business stood out to our judging panel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since Netpremacy moved from number 2 to 6 Wellington Place, I believe this has acted as a catalyst to enable us to have the capacity to accelerate our business and as a result, obtain significant Year on Year growth. The fundamentals of our key principles are based upon the following: Do the right thing, take responsibility, be transparent, continuously improve and take pride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This viewpoint has enabled us to build strategic partnerships with some of the most well established and recognised brands in the UK, giving us the platform to build an incredible team around it. I truly believe our agile, dynamic culture has attracted some of the best talents in Leeds and that we will have a fascinating future as the Cloud Technology market continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the goals of the business over the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will continue to follow our 5 key principles as described above. Due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in, we have a duty to support our customers during a time where things are constantly changing. We also have a responsibility to look after our people and ensure that we have the best practices in place as a business to provide a safe working environment and also to give people the flexibility to work in a manner that makes them feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growth remains a key component of our business - we continue to employ and have recently expanded our commercial team further. This shows a desire to keep growing and continue along our journey with Google Cloud. Our approach will be focused around aiding organisations to leverage Google Cloud Technology to remain competitive within their industry and use Cloud as a differentiating factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We recognise a lot of organisations will be focused on cost savings, efficiency improvements, and having the right technology in place to support a flexible way of working. We strongly believe Google Cloud will aid this significantly and will put all our efforts into aiding this and building further Partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NOMINATIONS FOR THE 2020 LEEDS DIGITAL FESTIVAL AWARDS CLOSE THIS FRIDAY 7th&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;AUGUST.

(88, 'Amsource release Remote Onboarding Blueprint', 0, '', '', '22c77b21753240cceacce1adb7f30bf1.png', '&lt;p&gt;During our first webinar on remote working, one topic that was frequently raised as an area of confusion was remote onboarding. With tech businesses still looking to fulfil projects, grow teams and remain ambitious, the process of onboarding new starters of all levels quickly became a task that presented difficulties &ndash; not only logistically, but practically and holistically, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can that human interaction be replicated to maintain that same welcoming atmosphere and informative nature without becoming alienating or impersonal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, and knowing there was a huge appetite for discussion around the theme of onboarding remotely, we organised an online masterclass with a panel of experts, allowing them to share their knowledge and experience with those hoping to learn and adapt in their own roles, giving the tech community a platform through which to share and collaborate in the hope that the sector as a whole can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With speakers from across the European tech scene, we brought together Irena Yeung from SolarisBank, Alasdair Thompson from BAE Systems, Matjaz Domen Pecan from Spark Networks and Anjo Gaul, who had been the Community Manager at TestIO. Collectively, the assembled panel had either been onboarding remotely &ndash; and successfully &ndash; before the COVID-19 pandemic had hit, or had quickly adopted their operations during lockdown to accommodate the changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full session is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hsgec8oeEA0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for those who missed it live or wish to re-watch, but we also worked alongside our panel to create a Remote Onboarding Blueprint, which we&rsquo;ve designed to help those recruiting within the tech sector maintain best practice, and have a constant reminder and reference point for all of the many factors that need to be considered when a new starter is joining in the current climate. Broken down in to twenty digestible segments to allow the user to create their own process from the information presented, it&rsquo;s a tool we&rsquo;ve already received great feedback from, as we wanted to ensure its usefulness before sharing widely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was just the second session in a three-part remote working webinar series, with the third and final part of that series a collaboration with MURAL focussed on remote culture and collaboration &ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/remote-culture-and-collaboration-with-mural-webinar-tickets-115958036609&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you can find out more about that event here&lt;/a&gt;.

However, working from home is different during a pandemic because there&#039;s an additional layer of stress and isolation that is much more intense than usual. Pre COVID-19, I was free to work in other locations like coworking spaces or a friend&#039;s house. Now it&#039;s clearly not the case and that lack of choice can feel suffocating at times, even for those who are used to working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important do you believe the culture and collaboration component of remote working to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s really key to have culture and collaboration top of mind in any company, but especially more so for distributed teams because this will affect how people communicate, how teams align and ultimately how connected teammates feel despite the geographical distances that separate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s even more complex in hybrid companies that have both offices and remote team members because there&#039;s a mix of practices from a traditional office culture and remote culture. With time, we can build in new habits and rituals that can overlap and satisfy the needs of both, but it takes a lot of trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you hoping that our webinar attendees will take away from your presentation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve heard a lot of complaints about working from home in the past months, understandably when it&#039;s been forced onto companies in our current global context. I hope that participants will understand that it takes time to adapt to new ways of working and collaborative processes, and won&#039;t give up due to initial hardships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If somebody was thinking of coming to the webinar but not completely sold on the idea, what would you say to persuade them it was a worthwhile use of their time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Culture is fundamental for any company. The fact that people don&#039;t give it enough attention is what causes a lot of issues at work. Be one of those people who actually give a damn so you can help your workplace be better!

Having that inside line on what both candidates want and aspire to, as well as knowing what hiring managers and companies actually value and look for in new recruits gives me a complete view on how to build a career in this space.&nbsp;This allows me the chance to speak to both sides of that particular dynamic and offer insight and advice that they wouldn&rsquo;t usually hear, hopefully allowing businesses a greater understanding of how to be better employers, and candidates&nbsp;a better chance of presenting themselves in a way that best highlights their talent.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one recent mentee had moved from the United States to Berlin with his partner but&nbsp;was really struggling to find work&nbsp;despite filing almost 100 applications for a front-end role. Having helped tweak his CV and application answers, as well as providing interview techniques and showing him in the areas in which he should be more engaged in the community,&nbsp;he found himself in the position of having three separate firm offers from which to choose.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With fourteen years of experience, I have helped countless people accelerate their careers and have been at the centre of the team building process for countless other companies &ndash; that leaves me perfectly places to speak to anyone looking for advice on how to take the next steps in their career, or provide insight to hiring managers who want to attract the best talent possible, but aren&rsquo;t sure how.&nbsp;Not just my career, the tech industry is a real passion of mine outside of office hours, and while I may not use the technologies I recruit for as&nbsp;an engineer, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped me from keeping up with all of the latest industry trends and&nbsp;developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the current climate how it is, with so many talented people out of work and tech companies still eager to fulfil projects under strained circumstances, I&rsquo;d love to help in any way I can to get our industry on the path to thriving again &ndash; and the Mentoring Club seems like an excellent platform through which to connect to the people who might want to speak the most&nbsp;and benefit from sharing my experience.

By being overly wedded to the idea of CVs, businesses can actually delay the hiring process and cut themselves off from the type of talent that could really boost their company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&rsquo;t to say, of course, that CVs have no role to play anymore. For those either out of work or actively seeking new opportunities, few things state an intention better than a CV being submitted &ndash; however, they are now only one factor that can be considered, and definitely not the only documentation that is helpful or capable of underlining career achievements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often, supplementary work such as GitHub links, LinkedIn profiles, Medium posts, Slack communities and personal portfolio sites can hold as much water as a CV would, especially where examples of work or passion projects can be evidenced and highlighted in a meaningful sense. For backend developers, publishing examples of code gives potential employers an opportunity to see a practical example of your work in practice, while UX designers and front-end developers can &lsquo;wow&rsquo; with their creativity and originality by marketing themselves with original work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most often, it is a blend of all of the above that lands the perfect candidate within their dream role, and marries ambitious businesses with their ideal hire. In this day and age, a CV alone just doesn&rsquo;t cut it like it used to, and that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; candidates have much better ways to highlight their own talent, and employees have a greater depth of material through which to judge potential additions. The faster we accept and embrace that new reality, the smoother the recruitment experience in tech will become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you a business looking to hire unicorn talent, or a candidate seeking a new opportunity but unsure of how to best position your experience?

(92, ', adaptability and acceleration: Rebuilding the technology sector post-COVID', 2, '', '', '5d5b06b67b8048da65ff3a24b42eda63.png', '&lt;p&gt;No industry was left untouched by the pandemic. Its suffocating presence forced us all to swim for our lives or risk sinking faster than we could have ever imagined. However, as Europe&rsquo;s &ndash; and the world&rsquo;s &ndash; economies begin their journeys on the road to recovery, digitisation will invariably be a key driver in stimulating growth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what is equally clear to see is that those businesses who were slow to adopt or placed themselves in containment mode until the proverbial storm has passed are already showing signs of falling far behind those who were quick to jump on the opportunities that lockdown provided.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While an industry damaged by the ramifications of COVID-19, the technology sector&rsquo;s broad scope for realignment and innovation has never been greater and the businesses that have, and still are, seizing opportunity by the horns are now reaping the rewards almost six months on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what does the future look like for the tech sector?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: Flexible working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The survivors of the pandemic are those that moved and flexed with every sharp peak and trough, the leaders that listened to feedback and implemented change, teams that banded together as a unit of strength and businesses that weren&rsquo;t afraid to accept the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with many other industries, flexible working was one of the first changes to enter the tech sector with force. Research by Amsource found that only a few months into lockdown, three quarters of businesses had changed their working patterns as a direct consequence of coronavirus, with only 5 per cent of respondents saying that having people working from home had a detrimental effect on company culture.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic, remote working will not only open up a much wider, more active talent pool which isn&rsquo;t restricted by location, but it will also be a driving factor for many entry-level employees who now consider flexible working patterns or remote working to be a necessary employee offering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: Filling the skills gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past 12 months has seen a strong demand from CIOs for software developers, and this trend isn&rsquo;t going to slow down post-COVID. This is partly because of the innovation and investment which many companies put into their software development initiatives during lockdown, as well as a foresight from many tech leaders who predict an upcoming shortfall in talent as COVID-19 restrictive measures are lifted further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the skills needed from candidates will shift away from the pre-pandemic norm with softer skills, such as emotional intelligence and collaboration, needing to be equally balanced with harder skills, such as UX and cloud knowledge. Whilst experience is still key, those more human-focused skills will be the determining factor for longer-term employee retention, with leaders wanting to find more dynamic candidates who fit the company&rsquo;s culture and ethos without any damaging friction.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation: The creation of more tech roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HR and tech, two traditionally very separate areas of the workplace are now kindling a new, much closer relationship post-COVID, both aligning to see how and where AI and automation could help HR efforts in tasks such as administration and assembly-line production.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While automation is not as new as the hype would have you believe, its potential has never shone brighter than it does now, with a striking number of roles predicted to be created through the technology in the coming years.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, speaking to ITPro magazine, I was keen to emphasize this very point. I told the reporter: &ldquo;The automation of labour is not a new phenomenon despite the hype, but what is striking is the sheer number of new roles that are likely to be created in the coming years.&rdquo; (read full article here). Research from Forrester points to an estimated 15 million new jobs entering the technology market over the coming decade as a direct result of automation and AI.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before we become very dystopian about it all, we need to try and dismiss the thoughts that robots are coming to take over our jobs. Instead, jobs will be created by technology and existing roles will change for the better.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceleration: It&rsquo;s time to up the ante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, we&rsquo;re seeing a rise in the number of job vacancies in the sector and while in normal times this might be a worry for the industry, it is in fact an extremely positive sign. Companies are realising that it is time to move quickly and recover lost ground from months of uncertainty in order to retain market share - it&rsquo;s time to build back those teams and fast.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only will companies need to work hard to refill traditional roles, but now is the time to look forward and begin planning for those roles that will undoubtedly be born out of the COVID-19 crisis that perhaps haven&rsquo;t been defined yet but will be profound for the future of tech.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any time of severe distress drives innovation and brings about change, and the current crisis will be no different. The last two years has seen technology advance at a speed and scale never seen before, and this will unquestionably be accelerated even further as will the range of new roles entering the tech space.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'Automation Adaptability Acceleration Rebuilding Post-COVID', '', 'automation-adaptability-and-acceleration-rebuilding-the-technology-sector-post-covid', 'yes', 'no', 1598918400),

(3, 'A Q&amp;A with Steve Trapps', 0, '', '', 'crop_5238652a386584e5a3b129935b5b406a.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi Steve, thanks for taking the time to talk to us today. We can see &nbsp;you&#039;ve had an impressive career in IT so far. &nbsp;What prompted / &nbsp;encouraged you to pursue a career in technology?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;That&#039;s no problem. Well I was 8 years old when the first personal &nbsp;computers became readily available i.e. ZX81, Commodore Vic 20. &nbsp;Building on messing around on these, when I had to make a career &nbsp;choice computing seemed like a safe bet. Growing up in the North in the &nbsp;80&rsquo;s, I also remember someone saying that you&rsquo;ll always have a job if &nbsp;you know how to use a computer.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI enjoyed creating programs and there used to be magazines that contained code listings that you could type in to the computer and then play the games. I guess that&rsquo;s where my skills in debugging programs started, as I&rsquo;m sure the magazine publishers would put mistakes in on purpose so that you&rsquo;d have to buy the next month&rsquo;s magazine with the corrections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom an academic point of view, I remember one Teacher at Park Lane College in Leeds who, when doing my BTEC, encouraged and inspired me not to give up when the program just wouldn&rsquo;t work as expected.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;In your most recent positions your roles have been working as a Scrum Master. We often see lots of debate online about what the role of a Scrum Master is. How would you define / describe the role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;On a day to day basis, it is to ensure that the Scrum ceremonies are adhered to by the team and to ensure that distractions are kept away from the team. So my role almost like a Team Bouncer and a Fixer, i.e. making problems go away!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAt its heart, the role is to ensure that team has every chance of hitting the commitment it made at the start of the sprint.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA Scrum Master isn&rsquo;t a team leader, or Project Manager, as they&rsquo;re there to help coach the team to always try to do the best thing for the situation. By having that person supporting the team and not dictating the solution the Scrum Master should have a good view of the situation and be able to advise accordingly.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What aspects of your role do you enjoy most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Helping the team to become better and learn how to do things better. Talking to people and trying to understand what their issues are and by working together, how the team can deliver what they need.&nbsp;Being able to coach and motivate a team to look at the situations and see how to improve. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are the day to day challenges you face in your role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;People assuming that you&rsquo;re a Team Leader. Although this is something that I can do, my role as Scrum Master is to support the team - not to dictate to them. The goals we should be working towards are self - organised and self-motivated teams. Without that you can put in as much framework as you want but ultimately the team will fail as they won&rsquo;t be exhibiting agile qualities. They&rsquo;ll just be going through the motions. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOther People Misunderstanding &amp; Interpretation of Agile frameworks.&nbsp;Scrum is a framework and what works for one company may not necessarily work for another. The secret is to work out what works for that company.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPeople often think that using Agile methodologies means you can cut corners and I&rsquo;m often quoted &ldquo;You&rsquo;re agile, you can do this&rdquo; just to get things done. The use of Agile is being quoted against you just because you&rsquo;re trying to do the right thing. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Agile has now been around 15+ years. Do you think it&rsquo;s reached its maturity, or will we see it continue to grow and develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I say that the Agile process is like evolution. We may see less innovation but it will continue to grow and develop. We&rsquo;ll see teams attempt new practices and the ones that are successful will continue to exist and force more changes as others try to catch up.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHopefully in the future, there won&rsquo;t be an &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; way. It will be the only way. After all we&rsquo;re just making sure that people and teams talk to each other on a regular basis. That&rsquo;s the beauty of working in an Agile framework &ndash; you can&rsquo;t hide anymore. Long gone are they days of a 6 month project where nobody knew what they were getting until the very end of the project. We talk regularly and often.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is still the need and projects where traditional methodologies work better than agile. Its just that agile is now seen as an equal approach to use &ndash; not just in small teams in &ldquo;digital&rdquo; projects. &nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are the developing areas of Agile? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s next for Agile?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I was going to say more mainstream acceptance. However that&rsquo;s already happening. Large governmental institutions have adopted using agile. The next thing for Agile is its adoption into other areas of business.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith the rise of DevOps adoption we&rsquo;re seeing new approaches being pushed into the full product lifecycle. Success in these areas, as we become quicker to deliver what people want, will force the areas that they touch - marketing, sales etc. to adopt techniques used within IT. For once, the bottleneck will be other departments and not anymore the IT department.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Let&rsquo;s rewind a little bit, tell us about your early technical career as a Developer. &nbsp;What tech did you start out using?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;From a professional point of view I started out using&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://delphi-tech.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Delphi&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/PowerBuilder&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Powerbuilder&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barclays.co.uk/PersonalBanking/P1242557947640&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nestle.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nestle&lt;/a&gt;. At Nestle I moved into the Microsoft world when learning Classic ASP (i.e. pre .Net). Prior to that though, I&rsquo;d previously seen Visual Basic 4 (VB4) whilst on placement at Proctor &amp; Gamble in my degree course. It was like a different world to what I&rsquo;d seen before.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBeing able to use the IDE to create buttons on forms was major thing for me. I remember seeing VB4 for the first time and being blown away with the ease that things could be done. I was basing my knowledge at the time on things I&rsquo;d seen done in Pascal and Cobol and wondered &ldquo;What witchcraft was I seeing &ndash; how long does it take a developer to create each button? They must work out the coordinates for each of the corners and somehow plot them on the screen.&rdquo; But no, it was drag and drop buttons in VB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;ve predominantly worked with Microsoft technology &ndash; what are your thoughts on the latest Microsoft technology (e.g. &nbsp;Azure, C#8)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is an amazing offering from Microsoft. As a developer I always worry what kit will I get and will it cope with the load when deploying into an environment. &nbsp;Azure has taken that worry away from me, as it&rsquo;s the same standard infrastructure and if something becomes more popular than first thought &ndash; no worries, just add in a new server and remove it when you don&rsquo;t need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It&rsquo;s has opened new doors for me. Technologies that I&rsquo;d be wary of utilising or are cumbersome to setup are readily available.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;-&ldquo;Want to stick a new caching layer in to your app? &nbsp;No problem, implement Redis and it is there&rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n-&ldquo;Want to see how easy MongoDB is to use &ndash; fire one up from the Azure Marketplace and have a play with it&rdquo;.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n-&ldquo;How does a CDN change your applications responsiveness? &ndash; No worries, just wire in one and see what happens.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It has brought a new world to my fingertips where I can compete with large companies by having the ability to call on the scale of Microsoft. Obviously you have to pay for the privilege but compare with going out and buying the physical equipment and software &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t compare!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to go Open Source &ndash; the right move or not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Yes, definitely. It opens up more possibilities and greater collaboration for the products that they&rsquo;re creating.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe community was looking for alternatives. Feeling empowered by this and being able to build the tools that they needed to deliver the products that they wanted, Microsoft had to do something just to keep up. They were in danger of become, in the future, a niche player in the development world.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe community has embraced the move and so you&rsquo;re seeing people like&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mat_mcloughlin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mat Mcloughlin&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and the work he is doing with others on&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnisharp.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OmiSharp&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;creating new and exciting possibilities.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;The rise of technology continues to make undeniable differences to our lives. How has technology changed the way you do your job now in comparison to when you first started out?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Being able to work from home, when needed. The work life balance is important to us all. If we&rsquo;re going to keep motivated individuals in the industry, having the ability to connect to all the areas I would be able to if I was in the office is vital. Happy colleagues make for motivated colleagues.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe ease of seeing and talk to colleagues in other countries, via Skype and other applications is great. At one time I was doing stand-ups with colleagues in Amsterdam, people working at home in the UK and with people in the office. We felt like a united team but were in 3 different places.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is a word of caution here, that too much technology in our lives can be detrimental. Always being contactable isn&rsquo;t necessarily a good thing. We should limit ourselves to its use especially at weekends and holidays. If we don&rsquo;t limit its access we may need to learn new behaviours and habits - otherwise we&rsquo;ll always be working and never resting.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What advancements in the technology sector excite you the most at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Slightly out of my area, however what&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;are doing is amazing. &nbsp;Building on the success of their more expense model which is really only available to the super rich, Tesla are enabling people to buy electric cars for &pound;25K. It&rsquo;s still more than I would want to spend on a car, but it makes the technology more affordable and hopefully sees the adoption of electric cars into the mainstream.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2016 is already set to bring some new and interesting digital trends and gadgets. Which trend/ gadget are you most looking forward to hearing more about/ trying out this year and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;For someone who works in technology, I&rsquo;m actually not that interested in gadgets. I keep a watchful eye on things but tend wait until things have become more mainstream. I still buy my music on CDs!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nConnect with Steve&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevetrapps?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=IvQQ&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CentityType%3AentityHistoryName%2CclickedEntityId%3Amynetwork_4736007%2Cidx%3A0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-steve-trapps', 'yes', 'yes', 1460073600),
(4, 'A Q&amp;A with EdTech Entrepreneur Chloe Barrett', 24, '', '', '51fd3bddc174a021fa19f96cdeeb18c6.png', '&lt;h2&gt;In this Q&amp;A we hear from Ed Tech entrepreneur&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-barrett-957453a1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chloe Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Digi Dentistry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDigiDentistry provides an advanced way of learning using augmented reality and animation, targeting all learning domains, offering a multi-language system and an intelligent E-learning platform. Enhancing and changing dental education for the better.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nChloe&rsquo;s inspiring work at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://digidentistry.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DigiDentistry&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;found her winning this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Young Entrepreneur of The Year&rsquo; Enterprise Visionary Awards. Chloe is also a finalist at the Digital Entrepreneur Awards, UK Tech Founder Awards, Great British Entrepreneur and UK Business Tech Awards.&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;In this Q&amp;A she tells us about her career path so far, plans for the future, her time in Silicon Valley and more...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us more about DigiDentistry - what it is, and who it is aimed at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DigiDentistry is bridging the gap between theory and practical learning, using technology as an enabler to improve education specifically aimed at academic areas requiring interactive content.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe concept of allowing this application to target all learning domains came from my own experience as a visual learner and a lecturer trying to accommodate all students learning styles in the classroom and develop homework resources which would be suitable for all students. In creating DigiDentistry I wanted to make a real difference in education.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDigiDentistry is currently aimed at Undergraduate Dental students, Dental Hygienists, Dental Therapists, Dental Nurses and Technicians. We continue to build our content to suit different levels of dental education and post graduate courses.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe have some exiting plans in the pipeline, expanding into other academic areas on an international platform but at currently we want to establish ourselves in the dental market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;How did the idea come to life?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I previously set up a dental education company realising the cost and time it was taking to develop resources. I came across augmented reality about 5 years ago, this was the moment I knew I needed to develop something using this technology. I visualised an interactive application displaying 3D images for example tooth procedures, rare diseases, from here it has evolved into much more.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What sparked your interest in the EdTech sector?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Education has always interested me. I love learning but like the other 75% of the population I am a visual learner, I learn better interacting with the subject. Technology is incredible, it streamlines processes, making tasks easier and reduces the time we spend on time consuming tasks. Technology must be included in education, we need to embrace the technology movement and utilise it. EdTech is growing at 17% every year it an exiting time to be part of this transition.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Do you feel you have had to overcome any particular barriers as a female leader in tech? If so, how did you deal with these?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, undoubtedly there are barriers, I feel I have worked hard to build sustainable relationships.&nbsp; I do feel at times I have had to prove myself more than many male founders I know, especially going through the fundraising process. Of course, I am outnumbered by men at most, if not all, tech events but in a way,&nbsp; I h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ave used this to my advantage, I think at least I stand out as a women in tech.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI hope to Inspire more women and encourage them to explore the world of technology and take on any challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;You spent some time in Silicon Valley, the tech capital of the world! How was that experience and what did you learn?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experience was incredible, I met some amazing people including other founders, mentors, advisors and investors. I learnt something from all of them. I learnt so much, but one thing that sticks in my mind is ensuring my business is not just working from a realistic plan alone. I allow for radical planning this means I always think big. No matter how crazy it sounds, if I visualise it, I will work to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEveryone I met has seen thousands of start-ups, so to be part of network who truly believe my company can go all the way is a feeling of accomplishment. Before I have even hit my peak, reflecting on this gives me confidence in the tough times.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;You recently were the winner of this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Young entrepreneur of the year&rsquo; award. Congratulations! What would your advice be to other young entrepreneurs who are trying to push their venture further?&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you, yes it really helped me reflect on how much I have done this year, being shortlisted and winning these awards makes you sit back and appreciate the hard work. This doesn&rsquo;t happen often; the entrepreneurial journey is a rollercoaster it&rsquo;s not easy to stop and take a moment to say well done to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe advice I would give is keep going, we only know our true strength during the tough times, starting a venture is not for everyone, it takes strength and resilience. Plan milestones and work hard to achieve them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What would you say are the biggest challenges facing growing start-ups at the moment?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&rsquo;s always challenges facing start-ups but a&nbsp; few I would include are access to funding, finding the right investors to support the growth and expertise. I think more transparency is needed in the funding process to ensure time is not wasted. We are all on our own ventures, not everyone will be aligned to join your journey but when you find the right people it starts to fit together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What has been the highlight of your journey with DigiDentistry so far?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There has been several highlights this year, I think the overall positive response we have received from people about what we are working to achieve with EdTech has been a major highlight and confirmation. Being accepted onto a Silicon Valley Accelerator and being given opportunities to speak at amazing events in a variety of different countries, this has given me great insights into different technologies and I have been able to meet some inspiring people&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtWoLDEKyXo&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Manchester is making a name for itself worldwide when it comes to its digital activity. What do you like most about being based in Manchester?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the collection of visionaries we have in Manchester, people genuinely want to help each other I feel like I an external team at times, we connect and work together for the better good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What can we expect to see from DigiDentistry in 2019?&nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 will be an exiting year for DigiDentistry, we are expanding the team, continuing to evolve our developments. I am really exited to show our new application features. We plan to continue to test our beta phase application in Europe and the US covering additional countries to really streamline our international expansion plans. We will continue to fundraise to support growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 8, '', 'EdTech', '', 'a-q-a-with-edtech-entrepreneur-chloe-barrett', 'yes', 'no', 1546128000);

style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;, DevOps: Culture &amp; Containers. &nbsp;The event brought together software professionals from across our region where they were invited to listen to talks surrounding two key areas in DevOps, take part in a Q&amp;A where they were able to ask any burning questions about DevOps and network with other like-minded professionals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot;

font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;. &nbsp;Clem delivered a talk all about DevOps culture, and the &lsquo;elephant&rsquo; in the room when it comes to DevOps and common preconceptions. &nbsp;Chris presented an interesting talk all about containerisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chris discussed the adoption of a container strategy, where to start, the gotchas to avoid and the benefits it can bring. &nbsp;Chris used real life-examples from his experience at Rancher working with large and small, public and private sector organisations to develop and implement container strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chris received a series of interesting questions after the presentation that included &ldquo;What is the difference between virtualisation and containers?&rdquo; And &ldquo;If containers share an operating system how secure are they?&rdquo; &nbsp;Chris provided the room with unbiased answers showing the pros and cons of adopting a container strategy. &nbsp;Notably Chris did inform the room that as container technology stands, having a full containerised environment is probably not advisable for various reasons including security and struggles with databases, but if implemented to the correct parts of the environment it can have massive benefits including the ability to run containers on any computer, on any infrastructure and in any cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clem&rsquo;s talk was focussed on the fact that bringing DevOps into an organisation is not just implementing a set of tools it is about implementing a specific culture and thought process. &nbsp;After Clem&rsquo;s presentation he received questions from those with already established &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; teams and those who are at the beginning of the journey. &nbsp;Some of the main topics discussed in the Q&amp;A included on &ldquo;How to get buy-in from Executive team / board?&rdquo; &nbsp;and &ldquo;Ability of existing team to upskill &amp; how to do this?&rdquo; &nbsp;As with most of these style of questions Clem revealed that the process of implementing DevOps is different for every organisation and there is no magic formula, however if done correctly it can provide many benefits including a shorter development life cycle and greater stability and reliability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot;

During this time we realised how far behind the sport sector was in terms of the use of technology. Many event organisers and governing bodies were reliant on aging or disparate IT systems, and in some cases were still working from complex spreadsheets or paper-based systems. One of the major contributing factors to this problem was that there was a complete lack of technology that specifically catered for the operational or business management side of sport. So we incorporated Sport:80 and started work on our platform.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Who is Sport:80 aimed at? Who uses it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Sport:80 Platform has been built for organisations that govern or manage sport. It&rsquo;s typically adopted by an International Federation, National Governing Body or Sports Club who use it to manage key areas of their organisations. Uniquely, the Platform can also be made available to participants &ndash; athletes, coaches, officials etc. &ndash; who can manage their personal involvement in the sport, such as purchasing their membership, entering competitions and managing their qualifications for example. We built the technology with this specific aim in mind; it was important that it could be used at every level to provide the governing body with an entire overview of their sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being a growing start-up, what challenges have you encountered so far and how have you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;I think our biggest challenge has been around behavioural change. The reality is that people fear change and because our technology has an impact on so many areas of a sports organisation, these feelings are often amplified when we get in to the detail of a project. Quite early on in our journey we had to come up with a way to quell our client&rsquo;s fears and give them confidence in our technology and our people. This has actually resulted in what is arguably the most valuable element of our business model; our partnership approach. We invest a lot of time in establishing strong working relationships with all of our clients and we take the time to carefully guide them through every stage of a project. Once the Platform is live and in operation, we provide on-going support and a personal level of service that most organisations are not used to receiving when it comes to their technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You were winners at the&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-stars/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;grand final!

There&rsquo;s no way we would have received the level of support that we did from the outset if we didn&rsquo;t have this clear vision and obvious passion for what we were doing. Some of our earliest supporters made it clear that this solidified their belief in us and our ability to achieve what we promised.

It is easy to get distracted by opportunity that sits outside of your natural product suite or development plan. Assess opportunity carefully and be brave enough to turn away offers that may hamper your ability to be the best at what you do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sport:80 is based in Sheffield.

I&rsquo;m not from a very technological family at all&mdash;the opposite, in fact! I didn&rsquo;t get internet access at home until I was 15 (2005) and my family all shared the one computer. I started off wanting to be a graphic designer and spent a lot of the time from 15 to 16, along with my then-best friend, Sam, working on logos and flyers and business cards for local businesses. After a good run at that, I decided that we needed a portfolio site to showcase our skills (we had no skills&mdash;looking back on it, the work was pretty weak), and volunteered myself to learn how to write HTML and CSS to build it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;em glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: italic !important; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not long after starting that, I realised that not only did I much prefer coding, I was much, much better at it. A series of self-initiated projects later, and I was pretty convinced that this was what I wanted to do full-time. At 17, I began applying for front-end development jobs in Leeds and was picked up by&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyjacobsleeds/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Jacobs, the Creative Director&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;at now-defunct Sense Internet.

My background is in large-scale product environments&mdash;I spent around three years as a Senior Developer at Sky, in Leeds&mdash;so I have a skill-set that these companies value. I guess I&rsquo;m just a little more naturally inclined to that kind of environment.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nAlso, the problems that these companies face&mdash;famous or otherwise&mdash;present a fascinating challenge for me. The proposition, the pressure, and the obstacles posed are a great chance to tackle something new.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nFinally, I guess that if you&rsquo;re working for a well-known company, your work is likely to impact a far higher number of people. It&rsquo;s quite cool to see an advert for Trainline and knowing that I was the person responsible for making that site faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&rsquo;re a Google Developer Expert.

There are lots and lots of new, shiny, exciting tools available, and more and more are appearing each week. While this does add an element of excitement, it also brings a lot a lot of fickleness, and what I see more and more is an entire generation of developers who&rsquo;re focusing on tools but neglecting the basics. Tooling, languages, and frameworks can be learned relatively quickly, but the fundamentals will never change; optimise for a stable baseline of understanding and then complement that with the specifics as and when you need them. That&rsquo;s a recipe for a much more robust and long-lasting career in tech, in my opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;SandboxRoot env-bp-350&quot;

It&rsquo;s this very fact that allowed me to specialise so heavily in CSS&mdash;I worked on defining and pioneering a lot of the approaches that people across the world use to manage CSS in large applications today. After doing that so intently for so long, I just got ready for a bit of change.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nToward the beginning of 2017, I decided to shift my focus more toward performance engineering&mdash;making websites fast! Performance work is something I&rsquo;ve been involved in for the last five years and was always a vital addition to the front-end development work I&rsquo;d been doing, but I want to make it much more front-and-centre. It&rsquo;s work I find fascinating, rewarding, and newly challenging: you can always produce a faster website; the question is how?&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s also a great way to add lots of value and make plenty of positive impact. Fast websites keep users happier, and they cost companies less to run; they cost users less to visit, and they also earn companies much more money. It&rsquo;s a scenario in which everybody wins.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\nA large sub-focus of this has been on the ethical and moral aspects of performance: users in poor-connectivity areas, or regions where data is costly, will genuinely struggle to visit a poorly optimised website. I want to focus on making the same information as accessible to those in rural India as it is in the centre of Leeds.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n(Fun fact: my website takes 1.3 seconds to load from Dublin. In Nepal, it takes closer to a minute. The same site is over 45&times; slower just because of the fact someone is based in a low-connectivity region.)&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;You have been based in Leeds for over nine years now!

(11, 'How to Attract and Retain Tech Talent', 0, '', '', '5a882d441ee65a0387a98f2092fcc4d1.png', '&lt;h1&gt;In this post we discuss the importance of attracting and retaining tech talent in a candidate-driven market.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Candidates in the technology market at the moment are spoilt for choice with the sheer number of great companies looking to hire quality digital talent&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s no secret that adopting a solid digital strategy and expanding through various technological channels is pretty high on the list of priorities for the majority of businesses. Therefore, ensuring they have the right employees with the relevant digital skills is becoming extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where talent pools across many industries are extremely competitive between candidates, with candidates having to tackle thousands of other applicants to fight for one role, it would seem that this is slightly different in technology. The&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/investment-in-digital-skills-still-low-69211124481&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;digital skills gap&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;has been a hot topic in the industry for a while now - the roles are there, but the top talent to fill the roles simply are not. This means that quality digital job seekers are often presented with 2-3 job offers from different companies at a time, taking the competition from candidate VS candidate to hiring companies VS each other.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSo in this &lsquo;candidate-driven&rsquo; market where job seekers are seemingly having their pick of the top digital jobs available, what would make a technology candidate pick YOUR company over the two or three other companies offering them a role? And equally importantly, what is going to make them stay?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Techies want a deeper meaning...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-to-hire-techies-silicon-valley-insiders-explain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inc.com&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;techies are looking for something to work on which matters.&lt;i&gt;&ldquo;A mission, a narrative, a way to dent into the universe&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;. Does your company have a clear view of where it wants to be and by when, and can new recruits envision being a part of driving the companies success? Are your recruits bought into your company&rsquo;s mission and objectives? More to the point, is your mission worth investing in? You can&rsquo;t just pitch techies a role and hope they&rsquo;ll drop all other offers with &lsquo;&lt;i&gt;yep, that sounds great, count me in&lt;/i&gt;&rsquo;. You need to paint a story of how their work will make an impact in what you are trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/brooklyn-our-lobby-in-sf.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Airbnb-EI_IE391850.11,17.htm?countryRedirect=true&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pic: Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Genius attracts genius&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTeam means more than you think.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-to-hire-techies-silicon-valley-insiders-explain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inc&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;also states that &quot;&lt;i&gt;who you work with appears to be nearly as important to software engineers as what you&rsquo;re working on. The most talented and interesting people in the world want to work with the other talented and interesting people. Genius attracts genius.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;It&rsquo;s important for tech professionals to be inspired in the workplace and have other people in the office that they can gain experience and wider knowledge from.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Up to date, cutting edge&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTechies want to work for companies that are continually improving and are current. Forward-thinking companies that candidates want to work for are exactly that &ndash; forward-thinking. They&rsquo;re always looking ahead for ways to continuously improve what they&rsquo;re doing and ensure they are keeping up to date with all the latest technologies, which keeps things fresh and exciting for their employees. If you&rsquo;re using a tech stack that&rsquo;s five years old whereas your competition is constantly upgrading their tools and technologies, you&rsquo;re likely to put yourself in a difficult position when trying to attract the right people to your organisation&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Company culture&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne of the biggest attractions for tech staff is company culture. Companies like&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/about/company/facts/culture/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/how-airbnb-is-building-its-culture-through-belonging/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;are praised for their amazing company culture. A positive working environment is a key priority for these companies and in return their employees enjoy working for them and tend to stick with them for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTech professionals are innovators, therefore their working environments should reflect this. The Silicon Valley giants we&rsquo;ve mentioned incorporate &lsquo;break out&rsquo; areas, where employees can get space to be creative and embrace new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOur client&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.financialforce.com/careers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FinancialForce.com&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;has embraced this into their working environment and company culture. FinancialForce staff are encouraged to use the break out rooms located around the offices, including free vending machines, play stations, and themed meeting rooms, moving away from the dryness of a typically corporate environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Google says that&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/blog/why-everyone-wants-work-google-and-how-attract-those-employees-your-tech-business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Focusing on output rather than hours worked and treating employees well, with on-site facilities like allowing pets in the office and up-to-date technology, all helps to create an engaged, motivated and happy workforce and there is no reason why these kinds of perks can&rsquo;t be introduced at smaller tech companies too.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCan you offer your employees an attractive company culture? And a space where they are going to continue to innovate and perform?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Incentives and company perks&hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile the projects and culture may be what initially attracts technology candidates to a role, the &lsquo;perks&rsquo; and the benefits of working for your company are what will make them stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHard work needs to be recognised. Techies, along with the majority of other professionals want to feel like they are appreciated for work and that their company recognises and respects their life outside of work also. For example:&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/blog/why-everyone-wants-work-google-and-how-attract-those-employees-your-tech-business&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&ldquo;The opportunity to work at Google attracts professionals as it provides an industry-leading maternity package to its employees. Intel offers its employees compensation for completing their MBA and offers free tutoring services to employees&rsquo; children.&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/google-dublin.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n(Pic:&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/blog/googles-culture-of-success/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NeilPatel.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nUnderstandably, smaller companies may not be in a position to offer all the same perks as those at Google and Facebook, but other perks such as flexible working opportunities and extended annual leave days are some of the things that definitely do not go unnoticed for technology professionals looking for a new company to join.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/nov/24/free-food-games-and-massages-why-techies-are-happy-at-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech jobs were found to be the best for work-life balance following feedback from UK and US employees:&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;web developer ranked highest in the UK, joined in the top 20 by data analyst, software engineer and design engineer. In the US, data scientist, SEO manager, social media manager and UX designer (user experience designer) led the pack. With the majority of companies hiring tech professionals seeming to be taking into consideration the above points, the results are paying off and clearly not to be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Are you a tech professional? Do you agree with the points we&#039;ve discussed? What attracts you to an organisation, and what makes you stick around? It would be great to get your thoughts.

vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Cashflow is key when starting and growing a company. Developing a primary MVP and supporting a live operational model requires cashflow. Whilst the traditional methods of funding are still available there are a vast array of other sources now such as crowd funding, private funding via high Net Worth individuals, venture capitalists, grants and innovation loans.&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Workforce Growth &ndash;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;One of the biggest decisions for any start-up is whether to outsource skills. Both have their benefits but ultimately finding and retaining talent is required and can be a challenge in itself, especially when recruiting for roles you may not be experienced in hiring for. Initiatives such as apprenticeships, training plans, flexible working and job sharing all attract and support the people needed to grow with your company. Finding companies that understand your sector and what talent you need to start to bring resource back in house, will be of great benefit.&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Diversity &amp; inclusion &ndash;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Often overlooked in the early years of starting up a business but having a truly diverse and inclusive workplace allows for diverse exchange of opinions and knowledge and will ultimately enrich your company culture and staff engagement.&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;Company Structure &ndash;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Just as lack of funding can be an issue, growing too quickly, taking on too many sales / contracts without the correct operational support can equally stunt a company. Taking the time to integrate core project management, development, sales and support processes that can scale with and underpin growth demands are vital for long term success. Without the correct internal processes and structure, businesses can find themselves stuck in a loop of gaining new sales but not retaining repeat business, which are the most profitable.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;&quot;&gt;You have recently been shortlisted in&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardladies.com/national-awards/&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 61, 117); text-decoration: none; transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The STEM Rising Star category at the Forward Ladies Awards and Summit&lt;/a&gt;.

They finish the programmes with new technical skills and a fantastic supportive network.

It is likely to be true that we do not attempt to store information in our own memory to the same degree as we used to, because we are confident in the reliability of the information found on the internet knows everything.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFurthermore, it is argued that innovations such as the internet, smartphones and tablets are affecting our ability to think critically and problem solve.&nbsp;The concern of many is that technology is in fact making us stupid.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Distraction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI&rsquo;m sure most of us will agree that technology is distracting. Whether it is stepping away from an important project to check your smartphone or flipping between browsers tabs without a real focus on one. We will have all been distracted by technology at some stage. It has been feared that this exposure to more distraction of this sort is in turn dumbing us down, with reports that distractions such as social media outlets could be responsible for lower exam results by up to 20%.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere is also a limit to how much information your working memory can take in at once. Attempting to take in too much information, something that happens a lot online, is like &ldquo;having water poured into a glass continuously all day long, so whatever was there at the top has to spill out as the new water comes down,&rdquo; productivity expert Tony Schwartz told&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/technology-intelligence_n_5617181.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Huffington Post&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;last year.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Forgetfulness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/technology-intelligence_n_5617181.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;millennials are more likely to forget what day it is or where they put their keys than people over the age of 55, and technology has been cited as a major culprit behind this.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-scientist.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;magazine recently commented &ldquo;This is a population that has grown up multitasking using technology, often compounded by lack of sleep, all of which results in high levels of forgetfulness.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The young and future generations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Google Effect will become a growing concern for parents as it is set to have the most notable effect on the younger generation in those under the age of 15 as well as future generations.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/24/tablets-apps-harm-help-children-read&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;recently reported that four years ago, just 7% of 5 to 15 year-olds in the UK had access to a tablet. By last year that figure was 71%. Some 34% of this age group even owned the tablets themselves, as well as 11% of 3 to 4 year-olds, according to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ofcom figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe popularity of tablets among children is a controversial topic, with differing views on the subject. Are these electronic devices with their apps, games and access to online video distracting children from more traditional, some might say &lsquo;more wholesome&rsquo;, activities, such as reading? Or preventing children from playing outdoors?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDespite these concerns, there are those that believe this notion of dumbing down by digital innovation to be nothing more than a conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell,&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;a vice-president at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/homepage.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;believes so. She says technology &quot;helps us live smarter&quot; as we&#039;re able to access answers. &quot;Being able to create a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, as you quickly work out what information you want to extract and identify the app to help achieve this, suggesting a level of engagement with the world that&#039;s not about dumbness.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt could be argued that with so much access to unlimited information about everything and anything, technology surely has a positive impact on ability to learn and gain information.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhat are your thoughts?

If machines are the future, humans will be needed&nbsp;to design, manufacture and monitor these to ensure that they run as efficiently as a human would - still requiring human workers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhat do you think?

No two days are ever the same and I amaze myself at how much I can jam-pack in every day!

I am also on hand to guide our technical team whenever a candidate isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;obvious choice&rdquo; for BJSS. I come from the recruitment world so my understanding of this space helps me to give an experienced view on who we should and shouldn&rsquo;t be hiring.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like about your job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;The challenge mostly. This is a very demanding role in an ambitious and successful organisation that is made up of 600 very clever people. BJSS has a great culture and it&rsquo;s given me a great opportunity to grow and develop my career. I also like that the management team is approachable and always available, pushing me to improve continuously.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What are the challenges you face?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As I&rsquo;ve mentioned previously, our team has to bring 150 new people into BJSS. The company prides itself on its robust recruitment standards, selecting only the best candidates. One of my biggest challenges is to ensure that we maintain these standards while finding ways to reshape and speed up our processes without compromising quality.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been in recruitment for 11 years, how has the industry changed through your career?&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I started my career in the oil and gas sector before taking the plunge into technology recruitment &ndash; a journey that gratefully led me to BJSS. The IT market is pretty similar to the international oil and gas market where skills are in increasing demand (albeit scarce), employers having to compete aggressively for top talent, and agencies running an account management approach based on headhunting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;BJSS is a massive company with a great reputation in the software industry. To someone that isn&rsquo;t familiar with BJSS, what do they do and how are they different to other software organisations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Well BJSS is an award-winning delivery-focused IT consultancy with over 20 years&rsquo; software delivery and IT advisory experience and we&rsquo;re renowned for technical excellence, cost-effective delivery, and our proven BJSS Enterprise Agile approach.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Can you tell us about what it&rsquo;s like to work there?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Brilliant! I love working here! The people are great, they&rsquo;re really talented and I learn so much from the brilliant projects they deliver. Our people get to use the latest technologies and tools and they love working on a variety of work. The benefits here at BJSS are great, we have amazing offices and we have a full social events calendar. It&rsquo;s a really happy environment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;If you were a software professional looking for a new role why would you want to work for BJSS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Very few companies can match the breadth of work, clients and technologies which BJSS offers. Our vision is to be recognised as the UK&rsquo;s leading privately-owned technology and business consultancy. To achieve this, we are progressively investing in the expansion of our capabilities so BJSS offers many opportunities for software professionals wanting to develop their skills and career paths.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The digital community in Leeds seems to be extremely vibrant at the moment. What do you think the appeal is to settle in Leeds for professionals and start-ups?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Leeds is a great city to live and work in. It has a casual vibe to it and it&rsquo;s a cool place to be. Everywhere is close, the cost of living better and there&rsquo;s a great quality of here. From a tech perspective, you can easily be at a tech meet up one evening and then finding yourself cycling through the Calder Valley the next evening.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What advice would you give to young people looking to pursue a career in the technology industry?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Contact me! ;) But on a serious note, get involved in the local tech community, ask from guidance from contributors on Stack Overflow and similar tools. If you chose a degree subject at 17 that no longer fits your career aspirations, that doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; companies are always ready to &lsquo;train up&rsquo; young people that fit into their culture.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso remember that your college&rsquo;s / university&rsquo;s career service can be incredibly helpful so make the most of it! Ask them to not only help you with career planning, but also to help draft and proof read your CV, and to prepare you for interviews. Some career services work directly with recruiters to help with placements, work experience and graduate schemes. If you approach a career service to help with opportunities, the service can contact recruiters on your behalf. Remember - you are paying for this service as part of your tuition fees - they are there to help you, so use them!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What have your experiences been so far working with Amsource Technology?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We have a great relationship with Amsource. The team understands our business and many of the candidates they send to us successfully progress through our recruitment process. &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What sets Amsource Technology apart from other recruiters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Amsource provides a high level of service.

The stereo type still lingers that boys are interested in more technical subjects like science, maths and I.T whereas girls are typically more stimulated by creative subjects such as English and the arts. At a young age a lot of girls maybe avoid being interested in things that are deemed &lsquo;boyish&rsquo; in hopes of fitting in with their peers. This is could be unfortunately contributing to the number of women studying technology related degrees and entering the tech sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;The fact that IT departments are heavily dominated by male employees could be putting women off from joining those departments. The lack of women can intimidate women into entering a profession where they may feel outnumbered or like outsiders. &nbsp;The lack of women in the industry also means that there is a real lack of women mentors who can guide other women and motivate them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A perceived Lack of effective promotion of the range of different roles available within the technology sector could be another factor. &nbsp;Not all roles in IT are purely technical and the range would appeal to different skill sets - Programmers, DBA&rsquo;s Testers, Business Analysts, Project Managers, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some factors aren&rsquo;t detracting women from entering the industry but are driving women to leave earlier once they enter.

Each network profile can be good for different aspects of your job search.

I&#039;m sure there are companies you are interested in and would love to work for, so why not interact with them? Facebook gives you the opportunity to interact directly with the company, bridging the gap, giving you the opportunity to put your questions out there to the company and could potentially help you get your foot in the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A company Facebook page is designed for interaction with customers, so the company would love to hear from you, it&#039;s what it&#039;s there for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&#039;s not what you know, it&#039;s who you know:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Another way to make the most of Facebook in your job search is to take note of your Facebook friends. I&#039;m sure you will have hundreds of Facebook friends, working in hundreds of different job roles and companies - use your Facebook friends to see what it&#039;s like to work at these companies, many of your friends may even advertise role vacancies through their Facebook page, so it&#039;s always worth communicating with these people. I&#039;m sure you will have heard the phrase &#039;It&#039;s not what you know it&#039;s who you know&#039; so get to know these people. What&#039;s important to remember when using Facebook is that you are branding yourself online, brand yourself as the type of person you would want potential employers to see you as, and turn your privacy settings to high, be mindful of what content on your profile is private, you don&#039;t want those &#039;Magaluf 2012&#039; pictures to creep up and bite you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;A great functionality that Facebook has is the Facebook group option. Facebook group groups can be about anything. Search facebook for job groups in your area, join groups relevant to your industry and get involved in the conversations taking place - it&#039;s a great way of making yourself known to recruiters in your industry who can help you, but also hiring managers and influences in your chosen sector it&#039;s also a great way to keep up to date with events that are being posted, advertised and shared in your chosen groups.

Many companies will let their followers know through updates on Twitter, if they are hiring so it is always worth following those companies you are interested in to heighten your chance of working there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;LINKEDIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is the perfect social network for job seekers. It is a business orientated network, therefore businesses use LinkedIn to search for candidates. Potential candidates use their LinkedIn profile as an online CV. When creating a LinkedIn profile ensure you use a picture that is professional and reflects how you would like to be perceived. Use your headline to your advantage - make it easy for recruiters to find you. Let them know who you are and what you are looking for - in a sentence. Follow those brands you are interested in and would like to work for. The same with Twitter and Facebook - comment on company profiles on LinkedIn and share/like content they produce to make you more visible to these companies. Companies will often advertise when they are looking for new team members through LinkedIn so it&#039;s important to follow these companies so you can see these updates and know what action to take next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Linkedin also email users jobs that may be of interest to them based on the skills and interests they have listed on their profile.

Few companies will use Instagram to advertise jobs. However it&#039;s a great way for potential employers to see more of your personality. So it&#039;s a great tool for you to market yourself and let employers see more about you, what your interests are outside of your career. However if you don&#039;t want to market yourself from Instagram and you think the content you post won&#039;t help, but hinder your quest for a job - as suggested with Facebook, ensure privacy settings are set to high.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;strong glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: bold; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;PERSONAL BLOGGING&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;A great way to set yourself apart from other candidates is to blog about your interests, especially if your interests work hand in hand with your dream career. For a lot of employers a candidate who is genuinely passionate about their career is more attractive than a candidate who may just see their career as a paycheck at the end of the month. This shows employers that the job you have applied for isn&#039;t just a job to you, you really are interested in obtaining a career in this field. There are many social media sites now dedicated to making your own blog - for example -&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a glober=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.theladders.com/career-advice/blogging-help-hurt-job-search&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 700; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;. Many companies are also using Tumblr so it gives job seekers the opportunity to follow these companies and hopefully draw company attention to their own profile and blogs. Through these company blogs you may be able to understand the company more and what the culture of their company from this you can get a better understanding of whether you would like to work there or not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&#039;s important to never underestimate the power of your social media profile, it could be what helps you find your next role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;span glober=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color: rgb(33, 65, 122); font-family: &quot; w01=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', '', '', 'the-social-job-search-have-you-started-yours-', 'yes', 'no', 1459987200),

(31, 'Top Skills You Need to Succeed in DevOps', 0, '', '', '22ecd9cec8cbdefda0e16618e455e6b4.png', '&lt;p&gt;DevOps is one of the biggest buzzwords in IT / software development right now, and it&rsquo;s only expected to get bigger. The collision of development and operations aims to enhance communication and collaboration between software developers and IT professionals, and the rapid growth of this market has resulted in huge demand for skilled DevOps professionals. As companies work smarter and introduce new technology, they&rsquo;re increasingly looking for people who can enhance their technical capacities and drive development efficiencies in the process. But what skills do you need to succeed in the world of DevOps?&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Experience with configuration management tools&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCandidates who can confidently use configuration management tools such as Chef, Ansible and Puppet will likely have an edge over those who cannot. These tools can help to support and optimise software deployment, and there are plenty of options to choose from. What&rsquo;s most important is the skill level of the DevOps professional wielding the tool, so whichever you choose, make sure you know it well.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Soft skills&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSoft skills can be as important as hard skills, if not more so, for employers. A 2013 Vanson Bourne&nbsp;survey&nbsp;found soft skills were the most in-demand attributes in a DevOps candidate, showing the need for professionals to be well-rounded. Clear communication, collaboration and flexibility are all desired by employers in the field, so job seekers would pay to focus on these skills alongside their more practical, technical knowledge.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;OpenStack knowledge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to a Dice salary survey, DevOps workers with OpenStack skills were amongst the top five highest paid employees. The cloud computing programme has set itself apart from the rest of the industry with its open source model and collaborative development process. It helps engineers to work quickly and maximises existing infrastructure, allowing for autonomy and innovation.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Learn programming languages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;Knowledge of programming languages is key for a variety of tech roles, and there&rsquo;s no exception for DevOps. Some of the more popular languages in this sphere include Ruby, Java, Python, Shell and Perl, but there are plenty on the market that&nbsp;offer&nbsp;something slightly different.&nbsp;Ideally&nbsp;a DevOps professional will have strong working knowledge of more than one language, so if you&rsquo;re looking to transition into this field or expand your career development opportunities, train up in a few.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Infrastructure insight&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDevOps&nbsp;engineers, in particular, should have a working understanding of data center-based and cloud infrastructure components. This includes aspects such as how software is racked in networked, methods for load balancing, running virtual machines and networking basics such as layers, networking in cloud and access between applications.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAre you ready to take the next step in your DevOps career?

An enduring theme amongst such failing projects was where organisations had adopted Agile for the first time, and in doing so had thrown away practices that had worked perfectly well for them in the past. Often this meant discarding all forms of planning and preparation in the name of emergent architecture and many-a-board covered in post-it notes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;A few of the anti-patterns I&#039;ve observed to be associated with such emergent (or omitted) architecture seem to be...&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Business value is the only driver of priority. Aspects such as risk or natural ordering of dependencies are disregarded.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Developer workflow jumping straight from business requirements to source code, with very little consideration of commonality or cross-cutting aspects&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Large-scale &#039;back-to-square-one&#039; refactors commonplace, often the same code being rewritten over and over and over again as new requirements are drip-fed in.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;No commonality of approach, different parts of the system solving similar problems in very different ways&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lsquo;Copy and paste&#039; employed as a reuse mechanism if time pressures precluded refactoring&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Non-functional requirements being ignored in favour of functional requirements, often rearing their head again in the path to go-live (or worse, in production).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if architecture is still needed, one thing that I think has happened is that the role of architects within Agile projects has evolved significantly as Agile has become mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Where we&#039;ve come from...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A traditional (if somewhat cynical view) paints a picture of an approach where Architecture was the preserve of a team sitting happily in their Ivory Tower, issuing decrees for the developer-folk to obey. Architecture was very much an upstream process, with designs flowing downhill but very little opportunity for feedback from the code-face as to what works in practice. A lack of code-level familiarity often led to over-engineering and reduced maintainability. Tactical decisions made downstream to &quot;get things done&quot; would lead to code that didn&#039;t match the design, or wasn&#039;t fit for purpose with respect to key non-functional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of this approach to Architecture was the sheer volume of documentation produced just to communicate between silos. Rather than spending their time thinking and designing, architects would spend the majority of the time writing lengthy documents, and a lack of face-to-face interaction would lead to a corresponding amount of time from the development team reading the self-same documents.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Where we&#039;ve got to...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under an agile approach architecture is now a much more integrated activity. The Architecture itself is vitally important, as it provides a framework and set of constraints with which to guide the design activities. In turn, those activities now being very much a collaborative effort involving architects and developers at the same whiteboard.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;This conveys a number of distinct advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Agile architecture is much more about thinking and communication; rich, compact documentation is still as important, but the production of reams of documentation for documentation&#039;s sake is diminished&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;An integrated feedback loop is provided, with the architecture, design and implementation constantly validating each other; that the implementation matches the design and the design operates within the framework set by the architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Given appropriate architectural constraints and guidelines, more of the design can be just-in-time leading to greater efficiency and more accurate low-level decision-making&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Everyone on the team contributes to the architecture (to a greater or lesser extent), not just those with the corresponding job title.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Architect now plays the role of the benevolent dictator, with a clear authority and veto, but no longer a lone voice shouting from afar. The pitfalls of design-by-committee are avoided, and a project retains a paper trail that is sufficient for on-boarding new developers, support of the system, and meeting client technical oversight requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural governance is still absolutely vital, and if anything is more important given the dynamic nature of an agile project. If anything, the transition being in the manner in which governance is applied - much less about writing a big (unread) book of rules &amp; principles up front, and more about getting inside the feedback loop and closer to the hands-on decision making (so ensuring there is an architectural governance aspect to the usual agile ceremonies - sprint planning, retrospectives, show-and-tells and the like).&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Emergent vs. Evolving Architectures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although my experiences with failing projects lead me to take a pretty dim view of emergent architecture, it is important that there is flexibility to change the architecture as the requirements change or are better understood. I&#039;d probably term this an evolving approach as opposed to an emergent one, with a number of key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Architecture identifies decision points and manages risks up front, but allows decisions to be deferred until later in order to provide flexibility of implementation.&nbsp;Refactoring is still an important tool, but it is a high-value activity to improve the system, rather than a constant tax needed to keep the wheels on.&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;A level of up-front design allows the client&#039;s technologists to be engaged - they can review and have input to technical decisions before they are implemented.&nbsp;There are no sacred cows, we anticipate and expect that the architecture will change over time. The key thing being we start with something tangible with flexibility built-in, not just a blank sheet&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;Constant grooming of technical debt; understanding that a small level of technical debt is often helpful in order to run a team efficiently and avoid gilding the lily, but actively managing this debt at the same time&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In Summary...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like we architects aren&#039;t going away any time soon, if anything, you&#039;ll be seeing more of us...&lt;/p&gt;', '', 8, '', 'architect', '', 'mark-pullan-of-bjss-the-role-of-an-architect', 'yes', 'no', 1456012800);

This is done by showcasing original content with a compelling storyline. Having adopted a youth-driven perspective, FFS prides itself on curating fresh authentic media that is receptive to a nation of food lovers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn addition to being a content creation hub, FFS has an inclusive online platform that enables users to discover premium dining offers based on location, timing and stock availability. This encourages vendors to drive profits from their bottom line whilst reducing food wastage and for users to discover the hidden gems that Leeds casual dining scene has to offer!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here, Myles tells us more about their journey so far, how the For Fork Sake dream came to life, what it&#039;s meant to be shortlisted at the Leeds Digital Festival Awards, and more!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about your career path so far, what inspired you to start your own business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I always knew I would do something off my own back, I was just never sure what it would be. From an early age, my brother and I have always explored our own little ventures whether it was working with creatives, student radio or even selling sweets at our boarding school.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe both have a passion for most things creative, which I feel naturally lead us down the path of creative marketing and advertising. I have been fortunate enough to work with some of the worlds largest brands such as&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diageo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diageo&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imperialbrandsplc.com/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Imperial Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.suntory.com/&quot;&gt;The Suntory Group&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and more. Bradley dare I say was even more fortunate to be able to work with&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/?ref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lsquo;Nike&#039;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;on an 8-week internship whilst filming &lsquo;Nothing Beats a Londoner&rsquo; (if you&rsquo;re from London and haven&rsquo;t seen it, check it out)!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFFS was birthed from the failure of a previous venture. Looking back now, it was the best thing to ever happen. Instead of doing a plethora of things to a mediocre standard, we cleaned up the business, streamlined, and now focus on delivering 3 things to an exceptional level.&nbsp; The inspiration for launching FFS came from a passion for bringing people together. It&#039;s something we do quite well, and what is one of the few things that connects every person on this planet? Food.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor us, food was the perfect vehicle to bring to life our expertise and passion under one roof.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/IMG_9789.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve had an interesting start-up journey, what are some of the biggest lessons that you&rsquo;ve learnt to date?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pretty obvious, but trust your gut.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nI personally believe you need to stick your hand in the fire and get burnt to truly understand what it feels like. I am sure a large percentage of people reading this can recall to a time when they themselves were burnt. It&#039;s not nice, but it&#039;s necessary. The combination of logic and emotion, it&#039;s called intuition, use it.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFires are always burning, it&#039;s the nature of the beast, but the way you tackle each fire is the true determinator. By this, I mean when we started, there was no doubt we were working hard but does that necessarily mean we were working smart? Each task is interlinked, take the time to review tasks, because by putting out 2/3 small fires, you may directly extinguish the huge burning issue that has been stressing you out for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRelationships triumph everything. I would go as far as saying 85% of our key achievements or milestones were hit outside of the office, away from the desk and certainly not over email or a phone call. What I mean by this is we have closed some of our most important deals or imperative conversations in a social environment. Why? Because those environments are where you develop meaningful relationships, you go a level deeper than just a formal introduction.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTaking a GENUINE interest in people, remembering their name (even if you have to write it down), doing your research before meeting someone, all shows and will pay its way later down the line, I promise.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, enjoy the ride. I was fortunate enough to have a breakfast meeting with Zeus Capital Founder Richie Hughes, and he said &#039;life is a collection of experiences&rsquo; - looking back even over the past year, time goes so fast that you forget to actually enjoy the ride. Take time to appreciate the small wins, because further down the line it truly resonates how monumental they were. There will be times when things don&rsquo;t go to plan, but those moments don&rsquo;t define us. How we react to them, that&#039;s what really counts.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about the tech behind For Fork Sake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The platform is built from the ground up and offers two primary services. These services are:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n1. A social community-based system&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n2. An exclusive menu interface&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe technologies that make up the social system of the platform include a live forums system for consumers to speak directly and review their favourite dining places, a content hub that runs off live updates. It has the ability to earn money for influencers and build a portfolio that&#039;s based upon a tried system that provides more rewards and creates more jobs. It also allows for the businesses and business employees to directly communicate with their customers and beyond, providing a more meaningful and well-acknowledged business presence.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe exclusive menu interface will be one of a kind system, offering exclusive menus and offers to everyone so that they can try new experiences and cultures without &quot;forking&quot; a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOur system, much like the business, has been built to remain fluid and dynamic, with the ability to update or maintain any outside API changes.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/ffs1.0.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been shortlisted in this year&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/ldf-awards-2019-meet-the-shortlist--98829148241&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds Digital Awards for One To Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fantastic achievement! What can we expect from you this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know right, what an honour to even be recognised! Expect big things from the Jensen brothers, we have just returned from a very successful trip in the Big Apple and we are looking forward to working more closely with our USA counterparts. Our team has now grown to a sizeable 18 people, which means a lot more content, a lot more noise, and fork ton more users joining our community.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBradley and I launched a consultancy &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/wearejensen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jensen &amp; Jensen&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; to assist businesses with their own marketing and communication needs. We want to be able to demonstrate the possibility of impactful bootstrap marketing for those businesses just starting out.&nbsp; Now our focus is about delivering high-quality original content that engages our audience. We have a fantastic team behind us mixed with foodies, creatives and techies, all working extremely hard. In addition, we have just moved into our new home on Aire Street, to have a solid base for FFS is imperative to the growth of the company.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe are also working with a large production company, but that is still in the works so&nbsp;hush hush&nbsp;for the moment!&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/IMG_8974.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is it about Leeds that makes it a great base for your business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was recently invited to the Leeds Digital Festival launch dinner, to which this was one topic of discussion. At the age of 24, I have lived in London, Birmingham, Spain, Liverpool and now Leeds. Leeds has something unique that I haven&rsquo;t seen in any other city, it&#039;s the true sense of collaboration and a willingness to truly help each other grow. Cities like London are an extremely competitive landscape, whilst Leeds is as well, I have found that people genuinely want to help and see others do well. You may find an investor or someone that would be really beneficial to the business, and they say unfortunately it is not for them but the difference to Leeds to many other places is they more than often will redirect or put you in contact with someone who&#039;s more suitable.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSecondly, students are our proving ground, and to have the most students per capita within the UK, Leeds seems to be the ideal home for FFS. Not to mention the bustling dining scene that is ever on the up within the city, with street food becoming more popular than ever and locations such as Kirkgate Market, Trinity Kitchen and Assembly Underground at our fingertips Leeds truly does appear to be the Mecca for a food tech business.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What advice would you give to other young entrepreneurs looking to get an idea off the ground?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone has ideas, that&#039;s the easy part. Look past the idea, to execute you need commitment and commitment requires time.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nStick to it; follow the 48, 7, 14, 28-day rule: 48 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month. If you&#039;re still head over heels and restless at night about this idea post this period, then it is more than likely a good idea to pursue it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCapital is overrated and can often&nbsp;can&nbsp;cause more problems. You don&rsquo;t need money to start a business, you need initiative and creativity. A lack of capital breeds creativity, creativity breeds originality, originality breeds authenticity, and in a copy cat world, authenticity creates value.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEveryone can sell, no one wants to admit their weaknesses. A Google partner took me back to school when he asked me to draw a SWOT analysis of my business. Clearly, I could identify and shout to the top of my lungs the strengths and the opportunity that the model presented, but the weaknesses and threats were lacking. No one wants to admit to the possible drawbacks of their business, but these are what hold the most value. The same can be said for NOs (I see NO as &rsquo;Next Opportunity&rsquo;). Nobody wants a yes man, someone telling you are doing great doesn&rsquo;t tell you anything at all, someone telling you why they disagree with your views holds the most intrinsic value. That is a potential customer giving you insight and brands pay millions for that kind of feedback.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon&rsquo;t wait, just do it. I see way too many people attempting to perfect the logo, the website, the name&hellip; the dreaded name. Honestly, pick a name, and get to market. I know it&#039;s easier said than done, but get the bare bones of what you need to get to market and start working, this way you are immersing yourself fully, getting VALUABLE user feedback and learning on the way. 20 days of doing something is far better than 20 days of thinking to do something. Naturally, the brand will change as you scale, and more than likely so will your consumers.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHire people that are smarter than you, different to you and see the end goal. Naturally, no one will have the same passion for the business as you, but recruiting people that make up for attributes you lack, people that can envisage the end goal and genuinely smarter people will not only build a stronger team, but you as an individual will strongly learn and benefit from it.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, time is your biggest asset, by a long way. I feel the entrepreneurial life has been glamorised, to be this amazing thing that you work for yourself, do your own thing and get rich. It definitely isn&rsquo;t like that and the quicker you realise this the better - you are in it for the long haul. Buckle down and give this the full attention it deserves, no one is going to do the work for you (at least not yet), surround yourself with motivated, happy and smart people.

You&rsquo;ve had a varied career so far. What initially prompted you to pursue a career in the technology sector?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I pretty much fell into it. After studying Geography at the University of Leeds between 1995-1998 my first job was in customer / tech support for Sage (UK) Limited in my home city of Newcastle. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about them beforehand but my dad is an accountant so when he saw they were holding a recruitment day he encouraged me to apply. I must admit it was a bit of a shock to the system but the training was fantastic, it paid well and the hours were good too as unlike other call centres, it was just Monday-Friday, 9-5. I was also dealing with quite complex queries about tax and payroll where you had to use your brain which kept things interesting. Even so, after 2yrs of being on a helpdesk I needed something &lsquo;more&rsquo;, started teaching myself basic web design in my spare time and landed a job as a Graduate Trainee Web Editor for British Airways in Newcastle which led on to all the other web and content marketing roles I&rsquo;ve had ever since, including a second stint at Sage as their &lsquo;Content Marketing &amp; Social Media Specialist&rsquo; between 2012-2015.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How has the tech sector changed in the last 10 years in the North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lsquo;The North&rsquo; has had many hugely successful IT and software companies over the years, including the aforementioned&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sage.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;which was founded way back in 1981 and has since grown to be the UK&rsquo;s biggest business software company and only tech business on the FTSE100. However, it&rsquo;s only really in the past 5-10 years that people started trying to join these digital-based companies up through networking and educational events and by marketing and promoting them as a collective whole known as the &lsquo;tech&rsquo; sector. Some of this was supported by the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) but most was done voluntarily by a bunch of enthusiastic individuals who wanted to create their own version of what they witnessed first-hand or heard was happening in places like Silicon Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Some of your more recent work has seen you working with Tech North. &nbsp;What are your thoughts on the &lsquo;Northern Powerhouse&rsquo; and the Tech North initiative?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technorthhq.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is loosely linked to the Northern Powerhouse concept which is all about rebalancing the UK economy, giving more power and focus to our Northern towns and cities which is something I and many others think is long-overdue. However, from what I heard on my weekly travels across the North I&rsquo;d say most Northerners actually hate the phrase, and see it as a quite patronizing and old-fashioned. Actions speak louder than words and unfortunately, most of the Northern Powerhouse conversations have been around transport infrastructure which is obviously important but very expensive and takes a long time to put into place. What I feel is more important and needed is an ongoing programme of small-scale events and initiatives that bring people together from across the North, opening their eyes to the opportunities and benefits of looking outside their local area to other towns and cities where they can network, collaborate and do business. This is what Tech North&rsquo;s &lsquo;Northern Stars&rsquo; competition has done very well by giving people a reason to travel to another city, often for the first time, to discover and celebrate what &lsquo;the North&rsquo; has to offer as a collective whole.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What has Tech North done to support the tech community in the North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;In addition to the &lsquo;Northern Stars&rsquo; competition, Tech North has done a huge amount of work to help shine a light on the great tech businesses in the North through their own blog and social media and this is something that they have really excelled at. Within the first few months it was surprising how many journalists and investors started getting in touch and enquiring about what was going on in the North, not realizing there was a tech sector up here which highlights why it&rsquo;s so important that someone is beating the drum for us and making sure we are not ignored by the national and international media. In the 8 months I worked as &lsquo;Community Engagement &amp; Partnerships Manager&rsquo; for Tech North, I spent a lot of my time matchmaking, making introductions between people and businesses, encouraging more collaboration within and between cities and putting small amounts of funding into events and initiatives which would bring people together and act as a catalyst to bigger things. I see this as a really important role for Tech North as unless they do this type of thing, I don&rsquo;t see anyone else doing it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;If you could describe tech in The North in three words what would they be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Innovative. Purposeful. Successful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What differentiates tech in The North apart from other up and coming tech clusters across the UK?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It&rsquo;s very hard to make sweeping statements about the whole of &lsquo;the North&rsquo; but in the early days of Tech North we did some work alongside the Northern Stars programme to try and understand what makes the North, &lsquo;the North&rsquo;, what makes it different to London and other parts of the UK, what connects our great Northern cities and what makes them all unique. What was really pleasing to see and hear is that there is a very deep social conscience across the North with people wanting to use &lsquo;tech for good&rsquo; and to tackle real-world problems. That&rsquo;s not to say people don&rsquo;t want to be rewarded and make good money from their work but many see this as a by-product of creating an excellent service that can make people&rsquo;s lives better. All 7 cities that Tech North primarily focused on &ndash; Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, Hull, Sunderland and Newcastle &ndash; all have thriving tech communities that are well-defined and highly evolved meaning anyone wanting to start a business, open another office, relocate or invest there will be able to hit the ground running whilst making considerable cost savings compared to doing so in London.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Do you think the tech scene in the North can emulate some of the world&rsquo;s most well know areas such as Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, Berlin and London?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I don&rsquo;t think we should try to emulate any of those places as each one has evolved due to their very special and unique set of circumstances caused by economics and geography. Having said that, there are things we can learn from how other tech clusters have developed and two books I would highly recommend are &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Flat-White-Economy-Digital-Transforming/dp/0715650653/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477434346&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=flat+white+economy&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=b1c56639d0c4a33b8a66f6ef42aa7d65&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Flat White Economy: How the Digital Economy is Transforming London and Other Cities of the Future&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Douglas McWilliams and &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477434435&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=Brad+Feld&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=72e61039a55eafc0512333592b1ddf86&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Brad Feld which have both informed my work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What does the North need to do in order to compete?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Be much bolder with our place marketing and messaging, but be honest with it too. We &lsquo;Northerners&rsquo; are often guilty of not doing enough to celebrate and shout loud enough about our successes because no-one likes a bragger or a loudmouth do they? However, if we don&rsquo;t do it who will? And if other cities and countries are better at this than we are, then the money and the talent will go to where it looks more exciting and our economy will suffer. At the same time, if we over-promise and under-deliver people will soon see through this and the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupheatmap.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Heatmap Europe Report&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;published earlier this year showed that in the case of Manchester, tech startup founders are saying that the reality does not live up to the hype.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Who are the real success stories of technology in the North of England?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There are way too many to list but anyone who has started and grown a profitable tech/digital business in the North that has created jobs where there is less hype and money to go around deserves high praise indeed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Is there one company who stand out?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Having worked for them twice and seen what a truly awesome company they are from the inside, I&rsquo;d say no-one comes close to Sage. They really are a phenomenally successful company that has created great products, jobs and wealth for hundreds of thousands of people over the years. It frustrates me that our British media and politicians often talk about wanting to create the next Google or Facebook when really they should be looking at the ingredients that led to the creation and growth of Sage and holding them up as the benchmark that others should aspire to be. Everyone in the UK should be proud to have such a hugely successful company as them which still has its&rsquo; global headquarters in the North of England.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would you say are the biggest challenges facing the digital northern powerhouse from becoming an internationally recognised digital hub?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We need more collective, joined-up efforts to promote &lsquo;the North&rsquo; as a collective whole on an international stage - encouraging foreign investors, businesses and talent to move to our Northern cities. This is something that Tech North were starting to do but they&rsquo;ve recently made their &lsquo;Trade and Investment Director&rsquo; redundant which means they have no-one with the skills, knowledge and international networks to do this well in their team anymore. It&rsquo;s even more important now that our Northern businesses and local councils work together and with national government to make sure that we are given the chance to promote ourselves on the world stage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;ve been called a &lsquo;Super-Connector&rsquo; by your peers in the tech community. Tell us what that means and what you do.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;About 5 years ago I read &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0349113467/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1477436654&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+tipping+point&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=plandigital-21&amp;linkId=222941c587c0533eb44ee8080748acc7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Tipping Point: How Little Things Make a Big Difference&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; by Malcolm Gladwell which explains why some great ideas work and others don&rsquo;t. In it, he talks about how in order for great ideas to spread like wildfire you need three types of people &ndash; Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. I was already pretty good at marketing (which is a form of selling) and I enjoyed discovering and sharing new ideas both at work and in my spare time so I decided then that I would set out to be the best I could be at all three things and have become known for doing this type of thing well for both employers and people around me who excite me through their work. My role at Tech North was the first time I was paid to do this type of thing on a full-time basis but it&rsquo;s only when I started my own business, Plan Digital, in April 2016 that I started calling myself a &lsquo;SuperConnector&rsquo; which is a bit tongue in cheek yet a totally apt description for the type of work that I do. After 6 months of doing this, it was really satisfying to be presented with the &lsquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/top-north-east-tech-talent-12060230&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Collaborator of the Year Award&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo; (sponsored by Accenture) at the Dynamites16 event last week!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absolutely delighted to win &#039;Collaborator of the Year&#039; at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dynamonortheast&quot;&gt;@DynamoNorthEast&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dynamites16?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Dynamites16&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;awards! ?????????????????&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechNorth?src=hash&quot;&gt;#TechNorth&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThisIsMINE?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ThisIsMINE&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ybh2vgHNb0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ybh2vgHNb0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&mdash; Paul Lancaster (@lordlancaster)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lordlancaster/status/789262519575711744&quot;&gt;October 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your latest project sees you working with Digital Agenda which focuses on &lsquo;technology for a change&rsquo;. Could you tell us more about this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Agenda&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is a recently-launched news and events platform which focuses on technology and digital innovation that has a positive social impact on people, places and businesses. Because of my background working for not-for-profits and social enterprises, I like to think of myself as a &lsquo;Social Entrepreneur&rsquo; and so am particularly interested in technology that is for impact, not just for profit which is why I&rsquo;m supporting Digital Agenda. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve been helping the team with their positioning, partnerships and sponsorships which include a series of roundtable dinner debates hosted by KPMG in Newcastle, Leeds and Manchester which have so far been sponsored by Muckle LLP and your good selves at Amsource Technology. We&rsquo;re also working on a big &lsquo;Impact Awards&rsquo; event at The Barbican in London in March 2017 which will celebrate the most impactful technology from across the UK. In my humble opinion, Digital Agenda&rsquo;s founder and editor, Julian Blake, is one of the UK&rsquo;s finest journalists so if you want to know more about &lsquo;social impact&rsquo;, please check out his excellent work at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.digital-agenda.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;and get in touch if you&rsquo;d like to sponsor a future dinner or one of the awards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;We sponsored Digital Agenda&rsquo;s City Impact dinner at KPMG in Leeds on the 18th, discussing how technology can continue to make changes to better our city. &nbsp;What was the purpose of the event?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;The purpose of the &lsquo;City Impact&rsquo; dinners is to bring up to 30 entrepreneurs, academics and public sector officials together over dinner to discuss some of the biggest challenges facing their respective city and to consider or suggest ways that technology is already or can be used positively in the future. Apart from being a great social event with stimulating conversation that is summarized in Digital Agenda articles like &lsquo;Leeds responds to future challenges&rsquo;, this is often the first time that some of these people have been in the same room together and so it&rsquo;s exciting to see new partnerships and collaborations forming which otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t and this is how new innovations and breakthroughs often occur.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In order for Digital Agenda to be a success what are the outcomes you&rsquo;d like to see it deliver?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lsquo;Social Impact&rsquo; is still a relatively new term and not many people know what it is until you explain it. However, once you do there is a real appetite for this type of work and so I hope that more people support what the Digital Agenda team are trying to do either by reading and sharing the content, attending the events or even sponsoring the programme of activity if they&rsquo;re in a position to do so. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s often the most important work in society that has the least funding behind it so it&rsquo;s vital that people and businesses support initiatives like Digital Agenda if they want to see better business practices highlighted and rewarded.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo find out more please visit&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digital-agenda.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.digital-agenda.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, Follow us on Twitter&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DigitalAgenda_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@DigitalAgenda_&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and Like us on Facebook&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/digitalagenda2016/?fref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIf you would like to collaborate with Amsource Technology on future guest blogs please get in touch&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:raj.bains@amsource.io?subject=raj%20bains&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-paul-lancaster-the-north-s-super-connector', 'yes', 'no', 1565049600),
(36, 'A Q&amp;A With Stuart Clarke, Founder of Leeds Digital Festival', 0, '', '', 'd91e38e2565b19daa7115e3be7ed1dcb.png', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;After a career building marketing and corporate relationship teams for the likes of Alliance &amp; Leicester, first direct and TD Bank of Canada, I co-founded a successful marketing consultancy working with clients across the professional services, digital and arts sectors. We help firms create long term strategic plans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;m also an advisor and non-executive director to a number of start-ups, and the co-founder and Festival Director of the Leeds Digital Festival, as well as being a member of the Leeds Digital Board and the co-founder of Media Yorkshire.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially interested you in exploring a career in digital?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I started my marketing career many years ago, before all the great tools we have now were available, so my journey was one of adopting digital methods and tools as they came along, rather than leaping into a digital career. Instead of waiting a couple of months to find out whether a direct mail pack was successful, it&rsquo;s great to be able to test campaigns on an almost real-time basis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;re the founder of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leedsdigitalfestival.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds digital festival&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lsquo;the north&rsquo;s largest digital festival&rsquo; can you tell us about how you came up with the idea, and how it&rsquo;s grown to the size that it has?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As with all the best ideas, it started in a pub. I invited a group of people working in the sector (a &ldquo;coalition of the unwilling&rdquo; according to one of the group, Alex Craven from Jaywing Intelligence) to discuss how we could make more noise about the great talent and innovative companies that we have in Leeds, and also how to create more collaboration in the city.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nI took on the role as Festival Director to see if we could get a festival going. Leeds City Council helped us with a grant, then we brought other sponsors on board and before we knew it, three months later we had the first festival happening.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe first Leeds Digital Festival in 2016 saw 56 events; the 2017 version had 115 events, with over 400 speakers across 58 venues. Over 10,000 people came together to hear about the many incredible things we&rsquo;re creating in this city. It&rsquo;s grown because we&rsquo;re giving people and companies an outlet to tell the city and the world about the great stuff we do, but also because it&rsquo;s a chance for collaboration.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe were very clear about having a city-wide, open platform Festival, where people can put on what they want; there are no curators telling you what is right or wrong. Most of the events are free which enables everyone to take part.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve started planning next year&#039;s Festival and already have some great events planned. Of course, we&rsquo;re always looking for sponsors, so please get in touch if you can help.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You work with a number of interesting start-ups in Leeds. You&rsquo;re also a founder of the&nbsp;London to Leeds project. Can you tell us more about that and what differentiates the start-up scene in Leeds compared to others across the UK?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I think the biggest difference in Leeds to other cities is that we&rsquo;re much more collaborative. There are over 25 tech meetups each month for example, where people from different companies come along and share best practice. This also applies to the startup sector where founders can be seen at events like Founders&rsquo; Friday at Futurelabs, sharing their experiences.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe scale of the city helps; even though Leeds is the third biggest city in the UK, the compact size of the city centre makes it easier to work with other companies.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re also seeing more students stay in the city after graduation to build their startup; they no longer feel that London is the only place to be. You can build your company and have a great standard of living here, which isn&rsquo;t always the case in London. Accommodation is a third of the price in Leeds compared to London and the beer is cheaper (and better!).&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe London to Leeds project encourages startups and tech companies in London to visit Leeds and find out what a great, digitally-connected city it is, brimming with talent. I take visitors on a walk through the city centre, that usually ends up walking through the Victoria Quarter and then to a bar like Headrow House; even die-hard Londoners are impressed with the buzz of the city.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would you say to a start-up torn between choosing Leeds or London as a base for their business?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nLondon obviously has many things going for it, it&rsquo;s the tech capital of Europe, but it doesn&rsquo;t suit everyone. As I mentioned above, the compact nature of Leeds makes it easier to find all the people you need; your funding can also go much further in Leeds. Leeds is only a couple of hours from London by train, so if you need to visit a customer or investor, it&rsquo;s easy to do so from your highly-affordable office.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;The technology &lsquo;brain drain&rsquo; is something that is heavily documented in the industry at the moment. Large tech employers based in the region including (Sky Bet &amp; Asda) are finding hundreds of their vacancies are being left unfilled. Your work with Signin sees you working with universities in the area to help retain tech talent in our city and counteract this problem. Can you tell us more about this?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Any conversation about the digital sector in Leeds invariably ends up as a discussion about skills and talent. We do need more people to fill the vacant roles and as a city we&rsquo;ve seen some really positive moves over the last couple of years. The universities and companies are closer than ever, which helps to keep graduates in the city; bigger firms such as Sky Bet and NHS Digital are also investing heavily in apprenticeships and graduate schemes.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a city, we&rsquo;re now making more noise about how great it is to live and work here, and that promotion is bringing people to the city to work. With a mix of homegrown talent, graduates staying in the city and people moving to Leeds, we should keep the talent pipeline topped up.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nSignin&nbsp;is an innovative startup that connects universities, students and graduates, to match internships and graduate roles with the right applicants, which will hopefully contribute to closing the talent gap. The founder,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/by-george-leeds-graduate-s-new-app-is-winning-top-marks-1-8750682&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George Biddle&lt;/a&gt;, is a great example of Leeds keeping hold of its students. Originally from Solihull, after graduating from Leeds University George could have set up Signin in London or back home, but wanted to stay in Leeds because it has everything he needs to build a successful company.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Leeds is booming with activity in the tech sector. What digital advancements / investments would you like to see in Leeds in the next couple of years?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;We&rsquo;ll start to see the impact of&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.leeds.gov.uk/new-tech-hub-set-to-arrive-in-leeds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leeds City Council&rsquo;s &pound;3.7m tech hub fund&lt;/a&gt;, which was invested across a number of projects. The first,&nbsp;Futurelabs, has already seen dozens of jobs created in software startups; the Platform tech hub, above Leeds City Station comes online in November. Together with the Open Data Institute and Duke Studios, these centres of digital and creative innovation will further cement Leeds&rsquo; reputation as the digital capital of the north.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ll also see more access to funders, the lack of which has sometimes held back the growth of digital companies. TechNorth are launching their Angel Network in the autumn; alongside the likes of NorthInvest and ADV, we should see more investment in the sector.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAbove all, I&rsquo;d like to see everyone keep banging the drum for Leeds on a city, national and international stage. Leeds is a great city and we should be shouting more about it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&#039;re getting more national coverage now than we used to, for example, Sky News&#039; Swipe tech show recently featured three innovative startups from Leeds; let&#039;s keep pushing the message that Leeds truly is the Digital Capital of the North.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGvOS0HnNpQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor further&nbsp;&lt;b&gt;information&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;visit&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stuartclarke.co.uk/&quot;&gt;stuartclarke.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', 'Leeds Digital Festival', '', 'a-q-a-with-stuart-clarke-founder-of-leeds-digital-festival', 'yes', 'no', 1507075200);

Leeds has something unique that we haven&rsquo;t seen in any other city. It&rsquo;s the true sense of collaboration and a willingness to truly help each other grow. Cities like London are an extremely competitive landscape, whilst Leeds is as well, we have found that people genuinely want to help and see others do well. You may find an investor or someone that would be really beneficial to the business, and they say unfortunately it is not for them, but the difference to Leeds to many other places is they more than often will redirect or put you in contact with someone who&#039;s more suitable.&rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/Top_7_Start-up_Cities_UK2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://technation.io/about-us/national-network/wales/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is being recognised as one of the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;fastest growing&nbsp;digital cities.

(41, 'The Life of a Software Tester', 0, '', '', 'a4a6a05665c76909e575964a0fbadfc9.png', '&lt;p&gt;Software Testers are an asset to any software team and as technology continues to innovate and develop the demand for Testers is set to continue.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHave you ever wondered what exactly it is a Software Tester does? Are you considering a career in Software Testing? In this blog Software Tester&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-marshall-95847235?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=REb4&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A123570644%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-3-3%2CtarId%3A1463570105370%2Ctas%3Abeth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beth Marshall&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;answers some questions about the role of a Tester and offers some tips to those seeking a career move into the sector...&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;In your own words, what does a Software Tester do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;This can be a tricky question to answer! &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a common theme amongst testers that their families and friends struggle to understand &nbsp;what we actually do. From my point of view, a &nbsp;software tester uses a variety of techniques and skills to review software with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of what goes out of the door. &nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, a good tester doesn&rsquo;t spend their time criticising developers, or finding as many bugs as possible.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;A lot of software testing, in reality, is about using your common sense, remaining pragmatic in challenging delivery environments and ensuring quality is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s your career journey so far?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;Like a lot of QA&rsquo;s, I didn&rsquo;t dream about testing software for a living when I was a youngster &ndash; in fact I had no idea it even existed as a &nbsp;viable career choice until I was in my mid-twenties! &nbsp;After completing a Law and Criminology degree at Sheffield University, I landed a &nbsp;role as a Project Co-odinator at the award-winning software consultancy&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bjss.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BJSS&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;Headquarters in Leeds. &nbsp;An opportunity arose to join a team tasked with reviewing a large set of manual test scripts. &nbsp;After proving I could hold my concentration whilst reviewing hundreds of test scripts I was asked if I wanted to become a junior tester on the same project, and was able to apply the knowledge I&rsquo;d learnt on the software itself.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the following 9 years I progressed from QA, to Test Lead and Test Management roles for clients all over the world, was lucky enough to work throughout the UK and US and made the big leap into contracting in 2015. Like a lot of people, it took an amazing mentor (you know who you are!) to sing my praises and open some doors, a lot of hard work and fair old chunk of good luck to get me to where I am now. I love working in a thriving tech community, and look forward to many more years of testing in Yorkshire!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s an average day like for you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;m currently working as a consultant Test Lead, which I&rsquo;m absolutely loving. &nbsp;My current client is&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.providentfinancial.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Provident Financial&lt;/a&gt;, a FTSE 100 finance company based in Bradford. A typical day involves attending stand ups, stakeholder meetings, organising workload for the test team, liaising with a tonne of people to ensure the test team are on track. &nbsp;I get involved early on in the delivery cycle to review requirements, trying to spot issues early on. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not above scripting and executing test cases either! &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like most about being a Software Tester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Honestly, I enjoy getting great quality software out of the door on time. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work on some pretty high profile pieces of work for some of the world&rsquo;s biggest companies, so I&rsquo;ve seen lots of things go live from FX Trading Platforms to major E-Commerce websites and it&rsquo;s an awesome feeling when something important enough to generate nasty headlines and damage a companies&rsquo; reputation if it&rsquo;s wrong gets released and&hellip;. It works! &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I also love establishing a team and making stuff better &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s improving cohesion between dev and test, or championing new ways of working which take off. &nbsp;There are always opportunities to learn new things, and lots of networking events in Yorkshire to meet like-minded professionals and exchange ideas. &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What attracts you/Software Testers to a company?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I&rsquo;ve asked a lot of software testers this question, and whilst everybody&rsquo;s different there are definitely some key themes:-&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n1)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Recommendations &ndash; the northern software testing community is a surprisingly small world, and people tend to know at least a couple of folk who work or have previously worked for most of the big hitters. If a company is rated by someone you rate this will probably trump most other factors. &nbsp;Similarly if a linkedin search of the company brings up a glut of former colleagues who don&rsquo;t have a great reputation but who&rsquo;ve been kept on for ages then it&rsquo;s a massive red flag.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2)&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;Technology/Domain &ndash; This seems to be less important to testers than developers, but if there is a particular area you want to break into e.g. Finance, banking or e-commerce or a technology or tooling suite you want to get involved in e.g. automation you&rsquo;re likely to be willing to take a salary hit in the short term to get the experience you need. &nbsp;Take a look at the top 30 skills real employers are looking for using itjobswatch to make sure you&rsquo;re skills are current and identify any skills gaps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Training opportunities &ndash; Any company that invests in up skilling and nurturing its testing talent shows it&rsquo;s a good place to work. &nbsp;Even for a contractor, where you are expected to hit the ground running, it&rsquo;s a good indication of a good working environment if permanent staff are given opportunities to grow.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n4)&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Structure &ndash; Personally, I like to work at places with flatter management structures, which listen to the team&rsquo;s suggestions and give everyone a voice. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been really put off some companies when I hear that the developers sit away (sometimes on a different site) from the test teams, as in practice I&rsquo;ve found there&rsquo;s no substitute for face to face communication (usually at the pub!). &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What are your top three tips for someone considering a career move as Software Tester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; &ndash; as often as you can! It&rsquo;s amazing the doors which open for you if you put yourself in a position to accept new challenges and stay positive and approachable&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n2.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;If you are the sort of person who needs to be constantly challenged and hates routine, then testing might not be the job for you. There is a heck of a lot of repetitive but necessary work, and if you cut corners you won&rsquo;t last long. &nbsp;If you are a completer finisher you&rsquo;ll love it!&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n3.&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Get your&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istqb.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ISTQB&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;qualification &ndash; there&rsquo;s varied opinions on how valuable this is to you in your day-to-day role, but for very limited cost and time commitment it&rsquo;s the best way of proving your interest in a career in software testing to recruiters and future employers alike.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThere are a lot of tips to be found in Beth&#039;s earlier guest blog post &ldquo;Testers top 10 ways to keep your job&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/testers-top-10-ways-to-keep-your-job-guest-blog-by-beth-68222145242&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;Keep up to date with more from Beth by following her on Twitter&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a data-show-count=&quot;false&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Beth_AskHer&quot;&gt;Follow @Beth_AskHer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere at Amsource we recruit a lot in the Software Testing market.

(42, 'A Q&amp;A with Kane Fulton of Tech North', 0, '', '', 'e8f32e0b0491a7467fabb3c59549b889.png', '&lt;p&gt;Kane Fulton has been the Community Engagement Manager for Yorkshire for Tech North since January 2017. He was previously the Computing Editor at the TechRadar, the UK&#039;s biggest consumer tech website. Kane graduated from Leeds Trinity with a journalism degree in 2009, landing his first writing gig at Shoreditch-based enterprise IT magazine Information Age in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSeeking a role that would allow him to tap into his love of computers, gadgets and consumer tech in general, he joined TechRadar as staff writer a year later. He worked his way up to Computing Editor, taking the helm of one of the website&#039;s most popular sections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter interviewing the director of Leeds Digital Festival for a feature, his interest in the city&#039;s startup scene was piqued. After persuading TechRadar to let him return to live in Leeds, he took on a second role interviewing local tech companies in addition to his everyday duties. Nine months later he successfully applied for a role with Tech North, a government-backed organisation set up to champion the North of England&#039;s tech sector. He now spends his time travelling Yorkshire interviewing its many stakeholders &ndash; from startups and corporates to accelerators, co-working spaces and public sector leaders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your current role sees you as Community Engagement manager at Tech North, can you tell us more about Tech North and what your role entails?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North&lt;/a&gt;, part of Tech City UK, is a government-backed organisation that was set up nearly three years ago to accelerate the growth of tech startups in the North of England. If startups are aeroplanes looking to take off, our job is to clear any obstacles on their metaphorical runway. There are many problems that could keep a startup founder up at night (and they&#039;re not always what you would expect!), so the challenge is identifying where we can make the most impact through our programmes and initiatives. We do this by homing in on &lsquo;five areas of focus&#039;, the first of which is profile-raising.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-stars/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Stars&lt;/a&gt;, our pitch competition that shines a light on the best early-stage startups in the region, is a major component of this; we also publish Tech Nation and other reports about the sector, in addition to articles about startup founders (and other stakeholders in the ecosystem) on TechNorthHQ.com. The other areas of focus are investment (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/investment/introducing-tech-north-angel-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tech North Angel Network;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/co-investment-fund/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;co-investment fund)&lt;/a&gt;, skills (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/northern-voices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Northern Voices; UpSkill&lt;/a&gt;), ecosystem (&lt;a href=&quot;https://technorthhq.com/programmes/founders-network/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Founders&#039; Network;&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;alongside identifying what we need more of &ndash; coworking spaces and accelerators, for example), and partnerships (securing private sector sponsorship for Tech North events and programmes). As community engagement manager for Yorkshire, my role is to be the eyes and ears of Tech North on the ground, and a visible presence for startups in the region. I help founders in a variety of ways &ndash; from connecting them with other stakeholders in the ecosystem to explaining how our programmes could help them. That&rsquo;s just the start.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you enjoy most about your role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;As a trained journalist (my previous roles have included writing for enterprise IT publications and editing TechRadar.com&rsquo;s computing channel), I always enjoy interviewing startup founders from Yorkshire and hearing their fascinating stories. Just last week, for example, I discovered that a company in Leeds was the first in the country to import and use the internet to sell Pok&eacute;mon and YuGiOh toys in the 90s. Founders tend to be highly appreciative of coverage due to a lack of attention on the region from the mainstream media. One recently offered to pay me for my time after I&rsquo;d filmed a video on their company &ndash; it goes without saying that I politely declined! Content aside, satisfaction comes from the small things &ndash; such as seeing people chat enthusiastically before swapping contact details at Founders&rsquo; Network breakfasts; hosting a successful event that fill&rsquo;s a venue&rsquo;s capacity; or seeing a startup founder deliver a knockout pitch in front of 200 people at a Northern Stars regional heat. I also run the local networking group&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/yorkshirestartups/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yorkshire Startups on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. People now post on it daily, and it&rsquo;s great to watch that constant buzz emanate from the local startup community.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What challenges do you face in your role?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Ensuring that all parts of Yorkshire feel like they&rsquo;re being served is a top challenge. Being something of a one-man band, I wish I had the ability to be in two (three or four) places at once &ndash; I&rsquo;m often having to apologise to people for not being seen as much as they would like and have to remind them that Yorkshire is a big place! On a related note, it&rsquo;s no secret that transport in the North is, shall we say, underwhelming. Trains are often packed, delayed and involve moving through routes where 4G signals are patchy (at best) &ndash; so adapting to working on the move has been a constant challenge since I started my role back in January. Juggling my responsibilities is another, and one that requires a structured approach to the day. Tools like Feedly, Trello, Slack, Evernote and Airmail 3 are invaluable in keeping on top of my workflow. Each day begins with a browse through bookmarked news websites to fill my&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nuzzel.com/kanefulton/yorkshirestartups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yorkshire Startups newsletter&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;before 9am. After that, I&rsquo;m either meeting tech companies, promoting Tech North&rsquo;s events and activities, writing articles (or shooting video), or undertaking admin duties. Usually it&rsquo;s all the above at once.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;How&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechNorthHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TechNorthHQ&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is working to boost investment in the North of England.&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OWUsitMBI5&quot;&gt;https://t.co/OWUsitMBI5&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qdAJyYQQTQ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qdAJyYQQTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Tech North (@TechNorthHQ)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechNorthHQ/status/922427387010342912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 23, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In your career you have worked in both London and Yorkshire, how does the Northern tech scene compare to London?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Yorkshire&rsquo;s tech scene is more laid back than London&rsquo;s. This is something of a double-edged sword &ndash; where founders in the capital can perhaps go overboard on the self-promotion front (driven by a need to stand out in a packed scene), Yorkshire&rsquo;s startups tend to be somewhat introverted and reluctant to sell themselves. Many of them should be shouting from the rooftops about the brilliant work they&rsquo;re doing &ndash; something that our friends across the Pennines have mastered in recent years. But we&rsquo;re getting better. Also, the more intimate nature of Yorkshire&rsquo;s tech scene means that people are less guarded up here, which makes them more open to collaboration. I&rsquo;ve seen tight bonds forged between startup founders, and a particular willingness from corporates to engage. People are rarely too busy to make time for a coffee to scope out potential opportunities, which is great. Other differences between the two scenes are fairly obvious &ndash; there&rsquo;s simply far more of everything in London &ndash; from startups and coworking spaces to accelerators and incubators. On the flip side living and workspace rental costs are stratospheric compared to the North, which means that a startup could enjoy a much longer runway in Yorkshire to get their idea off the ground before scaling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;There is an immense buzz around the start-up scene in The North. Your role sees you working on initiatives such as the Northern Stars Scheme. Can you tell us more about Northern Stars and how it supports northern start-ups?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Northern Stars is a pitch competition designed to find and raise the profile of the most promising tech startups in the North. Now into its third year, our previous winners have raised more than &pound;6 million in funding since appearing on the programme. We receive hundreds of applications from startups based in the region, and after three regional heats and a grand final &ndash; both of which see startups deliver three-minute pitches to a live audience &ndash; end up with 10 of the best. Northern Stars is attractive to startups for many reasons: first and foremost, it gives them an opportunity to display their pitching mettle (and what their startup is all about) in front of a sizable audience. For others, it&rsquo;s more about the prize package, which this year includes a stand at TechCrunch Disrupt in Berlin; access to investors at a private event held at the London Stock Exchange; media and pitch training; a stand at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam; and a place at the Northern Tech Awards, among others.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Read all about our visit to&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/NorthernStars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#NorthernStars&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Leeds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Leeds&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in our latest blog&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4oB0GXoFFo&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4oB0GXoFFo&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Tech&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Startups?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Startups&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalNorthernPowerhouse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DigitalNorthernPowerhouse&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0dBoukRm7i&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0dBoukRm7i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Amsource Technology (@AmsourceTech)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmsourceTech/status/908710664339849217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there any start-ups in the North that stand out to you at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Yes &ndash; many! In Leeds,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kwizzbit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kwizzbit&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;(a mobile pub quiz app) and&nbsp;Love Bomb Cushions&nbsp;(a retailer of emoji-themed cushions marketed with an augmented reality app) have found success after appearing on Dragons&rsquo; Den recently. Blind dating app&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jigtalk.co/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JigTalk&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;recently moved from Leeds to Manchester, which I&rsquo;ve only just forgiven them for (insert wink emoji), did brilliantly to win a place on the prestigious&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://business.nasdaq.com/discover/the-center/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NASDAQ&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;accelerator in San Francisco.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fllike.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fllike&lt;/a&gt;, a flight rating app based in Leeds, has one of the slickest interfaces I&rsquo;ve seen on an offering developed in the North. Machine learning-powered revision app&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://synap.ac&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Synap&lt;/a&gt;, also from the city, is consistently upping its B2B game. Sheffield&rsquo;s&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tutora.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tutora&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is going from strength-to-strength having just revamped its online learning platform, and Slanted Theory from the steel city is developing interesting and interactive VR solutions that aid data analysis.&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yboo.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yboo&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;from Holmfirth has developed what is possibly the most comprehensive app on the planet for helping consumers pick a mobile tariff &ndash; keep an eye on them. Over in Hull,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ash.tv/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ash.tv&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is going great guns with their mobile video advertising platform and have opened new offices in Amsterdam and Paris since winning Northern Stars last year. The success of software development studio&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcstudios.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arc Studios&lt;/a&gt;, also from the city, cannot be ignored &ndash; they went from winning an award at the Hull Digital Awards to sponsoring a category a year later! There are many other promising startups in the North &ndash; I&rsquo;d be here all day if I were to name them all. Keep a lookout on Tech North&rsquo;s website for our upcoming Ecosystem Map, which will list their names and locations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What other initiatives will Tech North be working on over the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Northern Stars and Founders&rsquo; Network, our peer-to-peer network for early-stage startup founders, run into 2018. We will also be developing two programmes related to helping startups secure investment (detailed in the answer below). Following the positive reception we received to Northern Voices, a speaker-training programme that aims to help to redress challenges like gender or regional imbalances in the sector, it will likely be rebooted in February next year. We will also be producing another Northern Tech 100 League Table, which this year ranked the fastest 100 growing tech companies in the North. There are other initiatives in the pipeline that we&rsquo;ll announce on our website when ready.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What challenges do you feel are most prominent in Northern Tech at the moment? (How do we overcome them?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Investment and finding skilled recruits (the latter particularly for corporates) are the two challenges that crop up the most. When it comes to the former, I&rsquo;ve had conversations with startup founders who have really struggled to find willing investors in the North. Many find that they have to jump on a train to London to have face-to-face conversations with them, such is their reluctance to travel in the opposite direction, whereas others look as far as the US. We&rsquo;re working on two initiates to help with this. The first is a proposed co-investment fund between the public sector and private sector business partners that would make up to &pound;30 million of funding accessible to startups in the region. The second is our Tech North Angel Network programme that aims to encourage more high net-worth individuals (or &lsquo;pre-angels&rsquo;) to become angel investors and invest in tech startups.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What technology are you most interested in at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It would have to be virtual and augmented reality. I was inspired to pick up an Oculus Rift after trying out new business solutions and games developed by Kotori Studios (based in Leeds), New Moon Studios (York) and Slanted theory (Sheffield). VR is incredibly fun and has huge potential in both the consumer and business space, but I think AR and mixed reality is going to have the biggest impact on both. That&rsquo;s mainly because it allows you to operate in your field of vision and see where you&rsquo;re going while wearing the headset, and partly because Apple is pushing the tech. That never hurts!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFollow Kane on&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KaneFulton&quot;&gt;Twitter&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;for more news about Tech North and start-up news across Yorkshire.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nWould you like to take part in a Q&amp;A?&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:raj.bains@amsource.io&quot;&gt;Click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 9, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-kane-fulton-of-tech-north', 'yes', 'no', 1508803200),

Here he tells us more about his career journey, being a Google Developer Expert and provides some insightful advice to young developers. Read more below...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey, I&rsquo;m Harry. I&rsquo;m a&lt;a href=&quot;https://csswizardry.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Consultant Front-end Architect and Performance Engineer&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;from Leeds. It&rsquo;s a bit of an obscure job title, but primarily I work with large organisations to help them, and their teams, write and manage large-scale websites. My focus in on scalability and performance, ensuring that front-end development projects can grow at a sustainable rate, while also remaining as fast as possible for the end user.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlthough my clients are very much international, Leeds is where I&rsquo;m based. I&rsquo;ve been here for just over nine years now and show no sign of leaving anytime soon; when I&rsquo;m not travelling for work, I can be found booting around West Yorkshire on either of my bikes or eating and drinking everything that this beautiful city can offer me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially sparked your interest in pursuing a career in technology?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;You know, it was a complete accident. I&rsquo;m not from a very technological family at all&mdash;the opposite, in fact! I didn&rsquo;t get internet access at home until I was 15 (2005) and my family all shared the one computer. I started off wanting to be a graphic designer and spent a lot of the time from 15 to 16, along with my then-best friend, Sam, working on logos and flyers and business cards for local businesses. After a good run at that, I decided that we needed a portfolio site to showcase our skills (we had no skills&mdash;looking back on it, the work was pretty weak), and volunteered myself to learn how to write HTML and CSS to build it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Not long after starting that, I realised that not only did I much prefer coding, I was much, much better at it. A series of self-initiated projects later, and I was pretty convinced that this was what I wanted to do full-time. At 17, I began applying for front-end development jobs in Leeds and was picked up by&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyjacobsleeds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Jacobs, the Creative Director&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at now-defunct Sense Internet. It&rsquo;s all gone on from there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have worked with a number of leading tech organisations. What attracts you to a company?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;It&rsquo;s a complete mixture of things, but I&rsquo;ll be brutally honest and admit that one of them is vanity: as a self-employed developer, having prominent companies on my client list is a real boon.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nBut, of course, there are plenty of much better reasons. My background is in large-scale product environments&mdash;I spent around three years as a Senior Developer at Sky, in Leeds&mdash;so I have a skill-set that these companies value. I guess I&rsquo;m just a little more naturally inclined to that kind of environment.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso, the problems that these companies face&mdash;famous or otherwise&mdash;present a fascinating challenge for me. The proposition, the pressure, and the obstacles posed are a great chance to tackle something new.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nFinally, I guess that if you&rsquo;re working for a well-known company, your work is likely to impact a far higher number of people. It&rsquo;s quite cool to see an advert for Trainline and knowing that I was the person responsible for making that site faster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You&rsquo;re a Google Developer Expert. Can you tell us more about what it means to be a Google Developer Expert and how you got to that level?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I am! It&rsquo;s a great honour.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nA&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/experts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Developer Expert&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;is an invited, non-Google developer who Google deem to be outstanding in their field. As well as technical abilities, they look for people who are good ambassadors within the tech community, who share and evangelise.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nTechnically, anyone can get there. If you&rsquo;re a great advocate and work hard to share knowledge in your field (mine is Technology, but the others are Marketing and Product Design), then a Google employee can invite you onto the program. Once they have made the invite, you then have to go through an interview process; first with an external Expert from the relevant area, and later an interview with a member Google staff.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIf you pass those, then you&rsquo;re in! You&rsquo;re a GDE.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/8899794454_6800d9c2d1_z.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You were also named Young Developer of the Year by&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Net Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. That&rsquo;s quite an achievement! What work were you doing at this time to be awarded such recognition?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Hah! I was. That was a few years ago now, but it&rsquo;s true.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAt the time, a lot of things had been happening in my career&mdash;I was beginning to speak at conferences with increasing frequency, I was writing a lot more articles, I was contributing to the open source space, and I&rsquo;d just started working for myself. It was a busy period for me, and I think that gave me prominence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What would be your advice to young developers hoping to make an impact in the technology sector?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/927183442130894848&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I tweeted something recently&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;which seems to have resonated with a lot of people&mdash;entering tech now seems a lot more intimidating than it was for me a decade ago!&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMy honest advice would be pace yourself, learn the fundamentals, and focus on integrity and resilience. There are lots and lots of new, shiny, exciting tools available, and more and more are appearing each week. While this does add an element of excitement, it also brings a lot a lot of fickleness, and what I see more and more is an entire generation of developers who&rsquo;re focusing on tools but neglecting the basics. Tooling, languages, and frameworks can be learned relatively quickly, but the fundamentals will never change; optimise for a stable baseline of understanding and then complement that with the specifics as and when you need them. That&rsquo;s a recipe for a much more robust and long-lasting career in tech, in my opinion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;When I was becoming a front-end developer &asymp;10 years ago, knowing \\`border-radius: 5px;\\` made you a rockstar. I do not envy today&rsquo;s beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Harry Roberts (@csswizardry)&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/927183442130894848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 5, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You have a large following on social media. How important do you think it is for technology professionals these days to be active on social media and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;For me it&rsquo;s vital&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great form of direct marketing, meaning I can get my message directly in front of those most likely to hire me. It&rsquo;s an essential business tool. I think that a decent command of social media is going to be crucial for anyone wanting to make their way in tech; the social proof alone helps to build trust and credibility. Though not a deal-breaker, I&rsquo;d be hesitant to hire someone for a tech role if they don&rsquo;t show at least some engagement with the tech community.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your focus has mainly been on CSS over the years, but recently your focus has slightly shifted, can you tell us more about this, please?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;CSS is a creative, fun, yet very imperfect language. It grants a lot of creative freedom but also is hard to tame at scale. It&rsquo;s this very fact that allowed me to specialise so heavily in CSS&mdash;I worked on defining and pioneering a lot of the approaches that people across the world use to manage CSS in large applications today. After doing that so intently for so long, I just got ready for a bit of change.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nToward the beginning of 2017, I decided to shift my focus more toward performance engineering&mdash;making websites fast! Performance work is something I&rsquo;ve been involved in for the last five years and was always a vital addition to the front-end development work I&rsquo;d been doing, but I want to make it much more front-and-centre. It&rsquo;s work I find fascinating, rewarding, and newly challenging: you can always produce a faster website; the question is how?&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s also a great way to add lots of value and make plenty of positive impact. Fast websites keep users happier, and they cost companies less to run; they cost users less to visit, and they also earn companies much more money. It&rsquo;s a scenario in which everybody wins.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nA large sub-focus of this has been on the ethical and moral aspects of performance: users in poor-connectivity areas, or regions where data is costly, will genuinely struggle to visit a poorly optimised website. I want to focus on making the same information as accessible to those in rural India as it is in the centre of Leeds.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n(Fun fact: my website takes 1.3 seconds to load from Dublin. In Nepal, it takes closer to a minute. The same site is over 45&times; slower just because of the fact someone is based in a low-connectivity region.)&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have been based in Leeds for over nine years now! Can you tell us how the technology landscape of the city has changed since you first became a Leeds resident?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I have! I adore this city! Particularly within the last five years, it&rsquo;s become such a bustling and vibrant place to be, tech or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;\nThe tech landscape has changed quite drastically, and fast. When I first moved here, it was a scene dominated by many small agencies, all competing for the same work. The upshot of this was that most companies began competing on price&mdash;&lsquo;we can do it faster, cheaper!&rsquo;&mdash;which in turn led to developers working long hours to fulfil promises made to clients by their managers. This overworking and underpaying (because tech jobs were not very competitive at all here until recently) then led to what I perceived as being quite a deflated and unenthusiastic tech scene: a city of developers who didn&rsquo;t want to go to meetups after a 12-hour day but just wanted to go home.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nAfter my stint in agency-world, I then worked for a tech VC firm around 2009. Weirdly, it was a complete flop. I mean it, nobody came asking for investment! That company was about three years too early for Leeds, which I still feel is a real shame. The entrepreneurial spirit hit Leeds much later than London. If that company had opened its doors in 2012 there&rsquo;d have been people queuing for a shot at funding for their startup.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn the last three-to-five years, the influx and rise of product-based companies in Leeds (Sky being the most obvious example) have led to much more attractive salaries, far more enthusiastic and engaged developers, much more exciting project and prospects, and has finally made Leeds a real tech hub as opposed to a client-services city.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMost of the agencies I encountered at the beginning of my time here haven&rsquo;t managed to weather the storm: slowness to respond to changes in the market, reluctance to compensate developers equitably, and sometimes even just lousy management has made way for a much more thriving and active scene. While I do find it sad to an extent, I think the developers in the city have won in the long run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How do you think the tech scene in Leeds compares to other tech hubs in The North?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I think the North&rsquo;s main problem is that our cities are always playing second fiddle to London, and therefore don&rsquo;t often compare ourselves to each other, but to the capital. I reckon we could do a lot more to band together and learn from each other, but all too often we&rsquo;re looking South. I do wish I knew more about other cities in the North, but I do know that Newcastle has a fantastic startup and incubator scene, the likes of which we don&rsquo;t currently foster. Manchester has some big players, but I feel like perhaps their focus is more on creative than on tech.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nMaybe that&rsquo;s something I should focus on in future: exploring tech in the North as opposed to much further afield&hellip;?&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;2018 is just around the corner. What tech trends would you like to see take off in the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Honestly, I&rsquo;d like to see less of a focus on zeroes and ones, and more of a focus on ethics, the impact of our work, and the hidden moral obligations we have as designers and developers. I&rsquo;d like to see people pushing back on requests to build software that can be used for harmful purposes. I&rsquo;d like to see teams taking a more proactive stance on things like accessibility and performance, to ensure that the products we&rsquo;re building can be accessed and used by people in different and adverse conditions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nTech is incredibly exciting, but while it&rsquo;s only serving the most affluent and fortunate members of society, it&rsquo;s all for nothing. I&rsquo;d rather see websites that work beautifully on the older phones prevalent in emerging economies than see another &pound;1,000 phone only available to the global top 5% of earners.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What is your favourite tech innovation and why?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Haha, this is going to be a disappointing answer, but I&rsquo;m not that into gadgets and the &lsquo;new cool&rsquo;. I spend as much time as possible away from tech and gadgets as possible&mdash;I&rsquo;d much rather spend a day with my mountain bike than with my laptop. That said, I did pick up an Echo recently which is quite neat. But then I circle round to my previous answer about ethics: the Echo isn&rsquo;t there to make my life easier; it&rsquo;s there to mine my data and sell things back to me. It&rsquo;s actually quite creepy really.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Do you have any new projects planned for 2018? If so, can you tell us more?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Nothing specific. I have some exciting client engagements lined up, and I do have some ideas for a couple of side projects I&rsquo;d like to (finally!) make a start on, but other than that I just want more of the same. I want to help people understand how they can better serve their users, wherever they may be.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 8, '', '', '', 'a-q-a-with-web-development-consultant-harry-roberts', 'yes', 'no', 1511481600),

It works by the referee identifying an incident that needs to be reviewed. Video footage is then reviewed by the VAR behind the scenes. Within seconds the VAR can then advise the referee via headset what the footage shows. A decision is then made by the referee to review the footage on the side of the field before taking appropriate action or the referee can chose to accept the information given by the VAR and then take action.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe VAR tech has been customised and improved over the last two years to meet the specific needs of football and to make sure it embodies what VAR ethos is : &ldquo;To minimum interferences and maximum benefit&rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/blog/hidden-technologies-at-the-2018-fwc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/1.VAR_TECH.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/blog/hidden-technologies-at-the-2018-fwc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(FIFA.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22001774&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Goal-line technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe were first introduced to goal line technology in the 2014 world cup in Brazil.

Developing a primary MVP and supporting a live operational model requires cashflow. Whilst the traditional methods of funding are still available there are a vast array of other sources now such as crowd funding, private funding via high Net Worth individuals, venture capitalists, grants and innovation loans.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Workforce Growth &ndash;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;One of the biggest decisions for any start-up is whether to outsource skills. Both have their benefits but ultimately finding and retaining talent is required and can be a challenge in itself, especially when recruiting for roles you may not be experienced in hiring for. Initiatives such as apprenticeships, training plans, flexible working and job sharing all attract and support the people needed to grow with your company. Finding companies that understand your sector and what talent you need to start to bring resource back in house, will be of great benefit.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Diversity &amp; inclusion &ndash;&nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Often overlooked in the early years of starting up a business but having a truly diverse and inclusive workplace allows for diverse exchange of opinions and knowledge and will ultimately enrich your company culture and staff engagement.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Company Structure &ndash;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;Just as lack of funding can be an issue, growing too quickly, taking on too many sales / contracts without the correct operational support can equally stunt a company. Taking the time to integrate core project management, development, sales and support processes that can scale with and underpin growth demands are vital for long term success. Without the correct internal processes and structure, businesses can find themselves stuck in a loop of gaining new sales but not retaining repeat business, which are the most profitable.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;You have recently been shortlisted in&lt;a href=&quot;http://forwardladies.com/national-awards/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&nbsp;The STEM Rising Star category at the Forward Ladies Awards and Summit&lt;/a&gt;.

(48, 'A Q&amp;A with Jen Talbot, Data Scientist at Intechnica', 0, '', '', '630873a547c38f4dabb7e0713c378874.png', '&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us about yourself...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I have been a Data Scientist at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intechnica.com/&quot;&gt;Intechnica&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;since July 2017. Previously I was an&nbsp;ESPRC Doctoral Prize Fellow&nbsp;at the&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://intechnica.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;in the Computer Science department, researching next-generation non-volatile memory technology. I wrote my PhD thesis on mathematically modelling thermal fluctuations in magnetic storage technology, also at the University of Manchester, graduating in 2015.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What initially drew you to a career in IT?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I studied physics as an undergraduate and physics and IT have a big overlap. When I went into research I decided I wanted to be researching future computational technology, although I was initially focused on devices and physical hardware. I spent the first year of my PhD building high-tech microscopy equipment and writing the control and analysis software. I ended up building a working model atomic force microscope out of Lego for university outreach demonstrations. I was more drawn to the programming and mathematical modelling side of things though and that became the most successful area of my research. I decided eventually that it wasn&rsquo;t particularly the physics that interested me, but using the analytical skills I had developed, solving problems and working in cutting edge research and technology development, all of which were more than applicable to the IT sector.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What appealed to you about specialising in Data Science?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;A lot of my work in academia involved data analysis and it was something I found both challenging and enjoyable. Towards the end of my PhD I became much more involved in data analysis and writing mathematical models and I discovered that I really enjoyed it. It was a bonus when I discovered that those skills were also very much in demand. I came to Data Science as it was a career that offered me opportunities to use and improve the skills I already had and develop new ones in the same area, while working on things that interested me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What do you like about being a Data Scientist?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Analysing and seeing patterns in data I think is the best part of what I do. It&rsquo;s a challenge from start to end, but when I&rsquo;ve got everything together and anyone can look at the visualisation and understand exactly what&rsquo;s going on without any further explanation from me it&rsquo;s really satisfying and I feel like I&rsquo;ve achieved something. I have presented a lot of data to a variety of audiences and there is a real talent in making sure what you&rsquo;re showing is understood quickly by everyone in the room. I&rsquo;m always trying to get better at it too.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Your current role sees you as a Data Scientist at Intechnica in Manchester, can you tell us more about Intechnica and what they do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Intechnica are world leading digital performance and scalability experts &ndash; originally known best for providing digital strategy and infrastructure consultancy for eCommerce applications worldwide.&nbsp; However around 18 months ago they release a web traffic insight and management solution based on advanced machine learning, which is where I fit in as a Data Scientist working with our Machine Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe product is called Traffic Defender and ensures websites can serve an unlimited number of customers and blocks out all the nasty traffic on the web.&nbsp; So, you can see it as having two parts, the first protects against peaks in traffic consuming more resources than there are available.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt ensures uptime and prevents sites crashing, and provides a queuing system to let all visitors access the site in a fair manner.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe second is the really clever bit where the data science and machine learning comes in. Businesses are plagued by automated non-human traffic (known as bots) some of this is good (like GoogleBot) however a lot are doing all sorts of nasty things on their site, such as stealing content, price scraping, launching attacks, creating fake accounts to get sign up offers, or trying to brute force crack customer accounts.&nbsp; In the middle, there&rsquo;s a whole set of bots that depending on your business, you may or may not want on your site. Some businesses want them, to promote their product with third party sites, other businesses will regard it as price scraping and content theft.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve built a system that enables businesses to manage their web traffic, identifying what is not human traffic and challenging it. The machine learning enables us to understand the intent of web traffic rather then look at access requests.&nbsp; From here we can provide insight into the nature of traffic, categorise it and provide the customers with their own choice as to whether they want to manage and optimise it, or block it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s a typical day like for you at Intechnica?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;I work on both real-time data analytics and retrospective insights into historic data. I don&rsquo;t think I really have typical days and everything moves very quickly. One day I might be putting together an in-depth analysis of web traffic and the behaviour of non-human traffic, pulling out highlights of good and bad bot behaviour and the next I&rsquo;ll be improving our real time behavioural analysis, updating the model to find new behaviours and stop a new type of security threat.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;How would you describe the tech scene in Manchester?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There is a huge and very lively tech scene in Manchester. Coming from the University of Manchester I was continually exposed to a lot of the start-ups that sprung out of various research topics and a lot of my friends went on to work in tech start-ups &ndash; or in a few cases start their own successful ones. There&rsquo;s a huge amount going on in the tech scene generally though and a lot of meet ups, hackathons and talks.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;Would top three tips would you give to anyone wanting to pursue a career in data science?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;There are a few good online courses for data science &ndash;Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree is good &ndash; and I would absolutely recommend doing a course on Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence for anyone interested in developing their data science skills as both areas of becoming more important to data analysis. I would also encourage anyone looking to pursue data science to make sure they are up to date on the latest technologies that are being used and be constantly on the look-out for opportunities to learn more. Finally, I would say that data science is a pretty broad area and it&rsquo;s not all programming and being comfortable with maths and statistics is a must, knowing what algorithms are doing and how they work beyond will save a lot of time and effort.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;What&rsquo;s your favourite piece of technology at the moment?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;i&gt;Obviously I&rsquo;m really excited about the advances being made in artificial intelligence and neural networks and that&rsquo;s an area I&rsquo;m personally interested in learning more about. I&rsquo;ve being dying to find an excuse to play around with Google&rsquo;s Tensorflow for a project. I also like to keep up to date on advances in biologically inspired computing and I&rsquo;ve read a few exciting research papers recently about using nanoscopic magnetic devices to store data by copying the way neurons behave in the brain.&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 1, '', 'Jen Talbot', '', 'a-q-a-with-jen-talbot-data-scientist-at-intechnica', 'yes', 'no', 1542758400),

Meetings continue over &lt;a href=&quot;http://amsource.io/edison&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt;, group chats keep the office banter alive and Friday afternoon beers have been replaced with a team pub quiz!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard work is also continuing, of course. While there have been obvious challenges during this initial period of readjustment during lockdown, it hasn&rsquo;t stopped up from doing what we do best - helping tech companies find the best possible talent for their needs. While some businesses have understandably hit pause on recruitment and decided to take stock for the time being, we&rsquo;re noticing those that have continued to recruit are flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the delay to IR35, we&rsquo;ve worked hard getting many of our contractors renewed, with our clients pleased to have the familiarity and reliability of proven talent available to them during a time where flexibility is paramount. Many businesses that had previously turned their back on contracting in favour of permanent hires have also reverted in light of these changes, allowing the contract market to be a hive of activity, which had started to slow in anticipation of IR35 being implemented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our clients looking to hire, grow and scale permanently have also worked with us to completely redesign their recruitment processes to allow for the new rules we have in place. One business, for example, used to operate a five stage face-to-face interview process, with colleagues from around the country having to travel to different sites in order for candidates to meet all of the relevant personnel before a hiring decision was made. In light of the lockdown, that has now&nbsp;become a two stage remote interview process via Edison, with hires already having been made and remotely onboarded, with both client and candidate extremely pleased with how the new process worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, we&rsquo;ve noticed a definite upturn in the number of clients exploring additions again, with the more settled and definite nature of the current situation allowing businesses to plan with more confidence, having seen the lay of the land and been able to more accurately project their health going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amsource will be working remotely for as long as we&rsquo;re required to, and during that time, want to help our clients remotely recruit, interview and onboard as successfully as possible.

Having already attracted 46 mentors from across a wide gamut of disciplines - with more joining all the time - it presents a worthwhile way to give back to a community that has allowed us to have the careers and lives that we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Young people or those new to the sector looking for guidance or start-up advice have no better place to turn for free, meaningful discussion on how to achieve what they want, democratising knowledge and networking in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t have been previously possible. Less than a month in to its journey as a platform, and The Mentoring Club is already attracting plenty of praise and attention, showing the potential to become an invaluable resource as word continues to spread.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time to get involved with such an innovative group of people, with the opportunity to participate in something so potentially meaningful and beneficial a rare occurrence. Especially at a time like now when so many of us have been removed from normality, it&rsquo;s great to see our community putting measures in place to remain supportive and progressive, which is a credit to those who&rsquo;ve spearheaded the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should you wish to get involved with The Mentoring Club as either a mentor or mentee, we would be more than happy to provide you with an introduction to the platform and get you in touch with the relevant people.

I just wanted to take some time to provide in insight why we&rsquo;ve decided to make such big changes, and how that will hopefully be a mutually beneficial decision.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why have we launched a new brand and website? It&rsquo;s simple, really. Amsource has evolved - and is continuing to - which is why we felt it was time to have a brand that reflected our company and work as it is today and will be going forward, rather than what it may have been in years gone by. We&rsquo;d left our old identity behind some time ago, and wanted to do justice to ourselves and the people we work with by working on our appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that our work growing tech businesses and being an active member of the tech community is something we&rsquo;re extremely proud of, and we wanted to give that much more prominence and visibility going forward. We wanted our brand to reflect not only our business more accurately, but the markets in which we operate as well - it was important that we had the same feeling of belonging in how we presented ourselves to the world as we do inside the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We aren&rsquo;t a traditional transactional recruitment business, and with our unique products such a strength of what we do and what we can offer, it was important to us that we gave them the best foundation possible. The way we can display and discuss the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://amsource.io/edison&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://talentsauce.io/&quot;&gt;Talent Sauce&lt;/a&gt; is now far more accurate for products that are deserving of headline status. We&rsquo;re a team who specialise in finding talent solutions, scaling businesses and being an indispensable advisory service - we didn&rsquo;t want our digital footprint to suggest any differently than that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As as extension of that, our new website has been designed to provide maximum insight in to who we are and what we do. We want clients and candidates to be aware of how we can help them from having landed on our site, and then talk to us more closely about how we can go about making that happen. We don&rsquo;t want Amsource to feel like a buttoned up corporate environment, because on top of delivering we like to think we&rsquo;re good to work with, too - we&rsquo;re transparent and approachable, so that&rsquo;s what our website needed to be, too.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practically, our blog is a knowledge hub that we aim to share useful, timely pieces through, with the ability to upload CVs, browse the job market and get in contact with us also fundamentals - despite not being the most glamorous to talk about! This isn&rsquo;t about form over function, so all of the tools and resources you&rsquo;d want and expect haven&rsquo;t been neglected.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Between these changes, we hope everyone that we currently do business with - and those we hope to do business with in the future - now have a greater understanding of Amsource, with a more honest reflection of who they&rsquo;re working with now readily available to them. We help businesses solve problems by hiring the right talent, rather than simply putting bums in seats - and our new brand and website just further underlines that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look forward to speaking soon,&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Maeer, CEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Amsource proud to unveil new website and branding', '', 'Amsource CEO Andrew Maeer discusses the new company website and branding - including the decision making process behind those changes', 'amsource-proud-to-unveil-new-website-and-branding', 'yes', 'no', 1589328000),

Whilst it&rsquo;s tempting to simply camp out in front of the television and mow through those Netflix shows you&rsquo;ve been meaning to binge, that sustained period away from work will make the transition back to professional life all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst it&rsquo;s unfair - and quite frankly unrealistic - to expect furloughed members of staff to spend their whole days as they would if working from home, there are some measures that you can take to not only better prepare yourself for the return to work, but further your skillset and career in the process&hellip;with plenty of time remaining to get through those boxed sets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refresh your training&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Refresh Your Training&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Refresh%20Training.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we&rsquo;re at work, we&rsquo;re often so focussed getting our tasks at hand completed that we lose sight of the training we&rsquo;ve received. The foundation to what we&rsquo;re doing, a lot of what we once learnt can be lost in the day-to-day rush of performing our roles, so this break could be a perfect opportunity to revisit those resources and reestablish the fundamentals. At the very least, it&rsquo;s sharpening skills frequently relied on, so there&rsquo;s no harm in that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn a brand new skill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_New%20Skill.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech presents us with infinite opportunities. With so many specialities, most people will stick to the field and area in which they feel most comfortable, becoming experts in their preferred language or code, whilst rarely touching on the variations. Businesses value flexible and multi-skilled employees, so by showing both the willingness and ability to learn and master new skills is an excellent method to not only expand your knowledge base, but boost your employability.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update your personal brand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Update%20Personal%20Brand.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may seem frivolous on the surface, but taking some time to keep your CV well organised and up-to-date, as well as ensuring your LinkedIn and other professional social media is well maintained can go a long way. Rival companies are always looking to hire, so even if you&rsquo;re happy in your current role, another opportunity might not be too far around the corner - so putting yourself in the best possible position to impress potential hiring managers with a slick CV and impressive online presence can be the difference between catching somebodies eye and not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reevaluate your career trajectory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Career%20Trajectory.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 200px; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A far more long-term train of thought, but we are rarely put in a position where we can take a step back from our careers and evaluate the route we&rsquo;re currently on.

While they&rsquo;re essentially designed to serve the same purpose as a face-to-face meeting, they can often be an entirely different experience to a more traditional exchange in person. However, making a good first impression remains imperative, so there are measures and behaviours to make yourself aware of before sitting down to be interviewed.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile there may be the possibility of a phone interview being requested, these are rarely formal stages during the recruitment process as hiring managers anymore, and tend to be a precursor to a meeting in person or via video.

Most conferencing software is now compatible with smartphones and tablets &ndash; as well as laptops and desktop computers &ndash; which should have the inbuilt speakers, microphone and camera that you require.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAlways test that these are operational, make dummy calls to people you know to double check that everything is being received well on their end, and this then removes any worry on the day of being undone by a technical mishap, which may reflect poorly on your candidacy if it&rsquo;s clear you&rsquo;ve failed to prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Remote%20Interviewing3.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px; height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take account of appearance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only should you make sure you&rsquo;re presentable by dressing professionally and holding yourself in the same formal, polite manner you would in person, but there are additional concerns about your surroundings that should also be taken into account. Ensuring that you&rsquo;ll be situated in a quiet, private area is essential, so that the conversation isn&rsquo;t ever interrupted and both yourself and your prospective employer can hear and be heard as clearly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nYou should also be mindful of what can be seen behind you by the camera &ndash; unmade beds and messy homes should be avoided, so if possible, sitting with your back to a clear wall would be ideal. If that&rsquo;s not achievable, then having a tidy field of view behind you is a must.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br style=&quot;caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -webkit-standard; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration: none;&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Remote%20Interviewing4.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px; height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&rsquo;t discount transferable skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While you may not be with your prospective employers in person, they will still be looking to judge your level of enthusiasm and engagement for the position being discussed. In exactly the same way you would for an interview in person, you should speak confidently and clearly, remove any distractions from around you and give your interviewer your complete, unbroken attention.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNot only should you have researched the role and company, but you should have questions prepared to ask back, with the right level of technical preparation done to ensure any competency-based questions can be answered in an appropriately knowledgeable manner.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you currently on the lookout for a new role in the IT and tech industry?

(59, 'Mental Health Awareness Week: 5 Acts Of Kindness To Perform During Lockdown', 0, '', '', '6b54f9ad1e4a4fd39678b1f06091c56f.png', '&lt;p&gt;This year, the theme of Mental Health Awareness Week is kindness. During such a challenging and strange period for us all, being kind to one another has never been more important - a worldwide pandemic is an issue we only combat when working together, building harmony and relying on our communities to help society function as normally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of the amazing work and sacrifice we&rsquo;ve seen shown by our incredible NHS and frontline workers, there have been incredible individual displays of kindness, such as the fundraising effort made by the inspirational Captain Tom.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With more spare time on our hands than ever, many of us are challenging ourselves to be more selfless and kind, and with mental health being tested so robustly during lockdown, there has never been a better time to make that extra effort - to not only benefit others, but boost your own sense of purpose and happiness as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Organise a swap station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple idea that many communities are embracing, swap stations are often left at the end of somebodies driveway in an easily discovered place, so that people out on their daily walks can simply happen upon them. Usually a large box filled with books, board games, CDs or DVDs, the premise is simple - for every item you take, you replace it with another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;This allows people to find new sources of entertainment during these extended periods of home, and facilitating something that is entirely reliant on community involvement provides a sense of belonging and achievement for those who&rsquo;ve taken the time to organise it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Deliver a care package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These don&rsquo;t have to be elaborate, but letting somebody you&rsquo;d usually be spending time with know they&rsquo;re being missed and thought of allows for a degree of intimacy our lives are currently missing. Whether it&rsquo;s a few chocolates and sweets, a face mask or some bubble bath, a little handwritten note or something you&rsquo;ve taken the time to bake, allowing someone to have that moment of surprise on their doorstep will go a long way right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Thinking about others and distracting yourself from any notions of isolation will brighten your day and broaden your horizons. Not only will the recipient feel loved and taken care of, you will have the benefit of knowing you&rsquo;ve done something good and selfless for somebody you care about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Reach out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simple? Yes&hellip;but none the less important. In the world of smartphones and Zoom calls that we live in, nothing is stopping you from simply getting on FaceTime to somebody you know might be feeling alone, or organising a quiz with your family and friends one evening to give everybody something to look forward to and feel a part of.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Allowing somebody the chance to talk is hugely important, especially if they&rsquo;re at home alone. A friendly face, a virtual shoulder and kind words will mean a lot, and could be the difference between somebody feeling alone or not. For people you&rsquo;re missing, this is a chance to miss them that little bit less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Support the vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many communities have set up local groups to volunteer within, so you know who needs help with what and where. With so many older people much more vulnerable during times likes these, if you don&rsquo;t have somebody within your immediate family or friendship group requiring assistance, it&rsquo;s highly likely you have a neighbour nearby that does. Helping with shopping and giving them some companionship is one of the most important tasks currently available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Not only will those vulnerable members of society feel looked after and safer during such a worrying time, you will have a renewed sense of purpose and achievement which may be lacking for those who aren&rsquo;t currently working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Get in the kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meals out and takeaways are either completely off limits or increasingly hard to come by, so why not treat those you live with to a nice home cooked meal instead? With more time to try different recipes, you could even split tasks and make a starter, main and desert individually. Staying in is the new going out, after all!&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental Health Benefit: &lt;/b&gt;Cooking is widely recognised as one of the most calming, meditative and fulfilling tasks you can perform. Learning new skills is a huge bonus, but letting your mind focus on something that you can later enjoy the effort from is genuinely gratifying for all involved, not just yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For those struggling with mental health, speaking out in the most important thing to do. It&rsquo;s okay not to be okay.

Make sure you have a conversation about mental health this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/get-involved/time-talk-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time to Talk Day.&lt;/a&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDid you know that between 2016 and 2017 that total numbers of people being treated for work related stress, anxiety or depression was 526,000? The total number of working days lost to these types of conditions during this time frame was an astonishing 12.5 million days.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith every job there is bound to be an element of stress involved. But what can be done to limit strain on your health and well being in the workplace? And how do we recognise and support colleagues who may be going through a difficult time?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s been reported this week that by encouraging a more open environment we should see a drop in the estimated 300,000 people who leave their jobs annually due to mental health problems, according to the government&rsquo;s Thriving At Work report, and reduce the associated costs to business which stand at &pound;30.3bn per year, &pound;105bn to the UK economy as a whole, according to the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wellbeing-in-mental-health-applying-all-our-health/wellbeing-in-mental-health-applying-all-our-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Department Of Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith it being Time to Talk day we thought it would be an appropriate time to further explore how as a team at Amsource Technology we can combat and better deal with work related stress and anxiety.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Open culture...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMore often than not many employees are reluctant or scared to tell their manager about a mental health problem which is when problems tend to spiral further.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nA survey carried out by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mind&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;revealed that 1 in 5 people felt they couldn&rsquo;t tell their boss if they were overly stressed at work and less than half of people diagnosed with a mental health problem have told their manager.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy setting a clear signal to employees that their mental health matters companies are creating a culture where more people will feel that they are able to come to management with their personal problems in the workplace. Many organisations can back this up with a mental health strategy in place. For example: counselling facilities in place, time allowances for exercise classes, team building exercises with health and wellbeing in mind.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBy taking proactive steps to create a more open and supportive culture, over time staff should begin to feel more confident to talk to managers about their mental health.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Recognise the signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAs mentioned before many employees feel that they can&rsquo;t talk to people about their mental health. Even by incorporating an open culture, there may still be some employees who find it difficult to open up. In this instance it&rsquo;s important for employers and fellow colleagues to recognise the signs.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;According to the Mind website, the main things to look out for are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in people&rsquo;s behaviour or mood or how they interact with colleagues&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in their work output, motivation levels and focus&lt;br /&gt;\n-struggling to make decisions, get organised and find solutions to problems&lt;br /&gt;\n-appearing tired, anxious or withdrawn and losing interest in activities and tasks they&lt;br /&gt;\npreviously enjoyed&lt;br /&gt;\n-changes in eating habits, appetite and increased smoking and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;If you recognise this in a colleague, what&rsquo;s next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTalking to someone about their mental health can be a difficult and uncomfortable one because the person being approached may not want to talk about it. Therefore knowing the best way to approach the situation is essential.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nChose an appropriate place: If the person is a colleague, addressing the conversation out of work premises or out of the presence of other employees is really important.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEncourage them to talk: Let the person know that you have noticed a change in them and that they are welcome to talk to you if they are experiencing any difficulties. By normalising the conversation, it may feel less daunting to approach you in the future about this. Ask simple, open and non-judgemental questions and let people explain in their own words how their mental health problem manifests, the triggers, how it impacts on their work and what support they need.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDon&rsquo;t assume: In these situations it&rsquo;s really important not to make assumptions. Don&rsquo;t guess what a colleagues symptoms may be and why they may be feeling the way they are and how it might affect their job. Many people are able to manage their mental health and perform their role to a high standard but may require support measures when experiencing a difficult period.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nEnsure confidentiality: For the majority of people with mental health problems they find it extremely difficult to open up about what they are experiencing. The last thing they want is to feel like everyone knows their problems and that people are talking about them. Confidentiality is essential and the person in question needs to have the upmost trust in you that what is spoken about is not then going to be repeated. Remember people may not always be ready to talk straight away so it&rsquo;s important you outline what support is available, tell them your door is always open and let them know you&rsquo;ll make sure they get the support they need.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n(Find more tips on the Mind Website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mind.org.uk/workplace/mental-health-at-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe hear about it a lot in the media, but the main step to combating mental health issue&rsquo;s is to lose the stigma, especially in the workplace.

Alongside health and fitness other popular resolutions tend to be career orientated with many people setting their sights on securing the job of their dreams, getting that promotion, pay rise or being all round happier at work in 2020.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHowever, in order to achieve these career goals, more ground-work and preparation needs to be put in place as opposed to getting yourself to the gym or eating more vegetables.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this blog we&rsquo;ll be providing some key points that should feature in your targets for the year ahead to help you live your best working life in 2020 and help you meet those career goals!&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a track of targets and monitor them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/aSZSj0mT8f6tW&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make a note of the goals you want to meet. Create short-term, smaller goals that are going to help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set yourself daily, weekly and monthly targets. Once you are able to see that you are meeting your smaller targets this will increase your confidence throughout the year as you will be able to visualise and see your success. Also &ndash; if you are behind on a target or weren&rsquo;t able to meet one of your smaller milestones you will be more aware and likely to make a conscious effort to stay on top of it in future. It will help you see patterns and recognise where improvements in your approach need to be made.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis monitoring will help you also organise yourself and prioritise your time which will also enable you to meet your goals, but also limit the stress that is sometimes associated with managing your time and working to different deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere are some great apps you can use to help you track your goals and stay on track.

Users of LinkedIn often share advice with their network as well as other useful information and blogs.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHiring managers and recruiters also share news about upcoming positions, so it&rsquo;s a great way to hear about exciting new roles hot off the press.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBeing active on LinkedIn and connecting with the right people is a great way to raise your profile in your industry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com&quot;&gt;Set up or update your profile today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Attend more industry events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/3o7qDEq2bMbcbPRQ2c&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attending more industry events will not only build your knowledge on a range of subjects in your area but will also connect you with other people in your industry. Events are a great place to meet people and build connections who may connect you to new roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking at events is also another way to get noticed and build your career. If you are particularly knowledgeable about an area of your industry, why not share this with a wider audience? Event organisers are always on the lookout for guest speakers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s easy to find out what events are happening when on websites such as Eventbrite, Meet-up and social media sites like Twitter and LinkedIn.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/111ebonMs90YLu&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&rsquo;re looking for a new role in the new year and take part in interviews it&rsquo;s really important to ask for feedback if you weren&rsquo;t successful in the process. By asking for feedback you&rsquo;re able to correct mistakes and build your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you aren&rsquo;t looking for a new role but are keen to progress in your current role it&rsquo;s important to ask your manager about your performance and what it is you need to work on in order to get to the next stage in your career. By asking about this, it will not only show commitment to your role but also will enable you to incorporate this feedback into your targets so you are clear in what you are working towards and what you need to achieve to get there.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Try to take more risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/zOuMplFlHPPoI&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Try something new in 2020 and step out of your comfort zone. Albert Einstein famously described insanity as &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are not where you would like to be in your career, you need to be prepared to change things, try something new and step out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals!&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'New Year&#039;s resolution', '', 'new-year-s-resolutions-live-your-best-work-life-in-2020-', 'yes', 'no', 1577836800),

Whether through a simple tweet, post on Instagram or a status update on Facebook, we can instantly be made aware of aware of different issues around the world than we ever were before.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAn example of when social media has been a great tool in raising awareness was in the summer of 2014. Unless you we&rsquo;re living under a rock at that time, you will be familiar with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alsassociation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#ALSicebucketchallenge&lt;/a&gt; that took social media by storm. This involved &nbsp;social media users making videos of themselves throwing buckets of ice cold water over each other or themselves and nominating their friends to do the same whilst also donating money to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alsa.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALS Charity (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS6ysDFTbLU&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe campaign played a huge role in helping the association raise $115 million. As of August 2014, it had resulted in 1.2 million related &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/alsassociation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; videos and 2.2 million Twitter mentions.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Ice Bucket Challenge &quot;was possibly the most successful social media fundraising and awareness effort I&#039;ve ever seen,&quot; says Mike Koehler, president, &lt;a href=&quot;http://smirknewmedia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&ldquo;Smirk New Media&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks in no small part to a lot of celebrity involvement, the campaign achieved pure viral &quot;magic,&quot; according to Koehler.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://millennialceo.com/social-media/social-media-changed-communicate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;COMMUNICATION&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media and networking have broken the barriers when it comes to communicating and we are spoilt for choice when it comes to ways of getting in contact with someone.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nToday, if you can&rsquo;t reach someone on the phone, you can leave a voice mail or send a text. Or even better, tweet, Facebook message, or touch base in other ways. We have the ability to see what others are doing, often within seconds of them doing it.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media search functions also make it easier if we want to track someone down who we are looking for or may have lost touch with. There are seemingly endless sources we can search to access the information we need.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-tell-stories-with-facebook-and-instagram-carousel-ads/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TELL YOUR STORY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given everybody who chooses to sign up to a platform, the opportunitiy to tell &#039;their story&#039; online. Whether that is through Facebook, Instagram pictures, Tumblr blogs. Normal people now have the capacity to make their opinion known on a massive scale.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://returnonnow.com/2014/09/how-social-media-has-changed-us-the-good-and-the-bad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;It is far easier to do something remarkable, noticeable and have it reach people across the planet than it had at any other time in history.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn turn this has created a whole new category of &#039;fame&#039; and &#039;celebrity&#039; - Social media famous. Every day social media users have the capacity to gain worldwide fame and impressive fortune simply by logging and posting their content. Take beauty vlogger &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoella.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zoe Sugg ( also known as &#039;Zoella&#039;&lt;/a&gt;) for example, Zoe has gained worldwide fame and popularity through uploading helpful beauty blogs on to social media site Youtube. Since opening her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/zoella280390?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; in 2009, Zoella has gained an impressive 6.5 million followers world wide (and growing) and has earnt an estimated &pound;3.5 million fortune. Just proving the impact social media can have on everyday people.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTx0haEjHok&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/ca/stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Snapchat&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; &#039;Story&#039; function allows users to share a series of 10 second videos that can be posted to the user&#039;s story for 24 hours. Giving snap chatters the opportunity to share a timeline of videos throughout their day, and film important events as and when they happen. Brands are using it as a way to connect with customers, and celebrities are using it as a way to connect with fans and to give their followers an insider&#039;s look at what goes on in their everyday life.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SHARE YOUR OPINION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given everyday people the ability to have a voice that can reach millions of people. Before social media was such a big element in our lives, you could have an opinion, or a view on something and only really your close knit group of friends or family would know about it. But given how easy social media makes it to reach other people, more people are using social media as an outlet to vent, and share their thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhile this can be a great tool (as we&#039;ve highlighted above) with raising awareness for worthy causes or sharing important news with your network. Many social media users have found themselves in extremely hot water when it comes to sharing an opinion online that may not be a welcome opinon, or a view that might have the capacity to offend people. For instance people have found themselves fired from positions, or on the face of news publications for over sharing, or making comments on issues that &nbsp;has caused mass offense. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-fired-2011-5?IR=T&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;IF YOUR NOT PAYING FOR IT, YOU&#039;RE THE PRODUCT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFacebook for example embodies this philosophy and has created a whole empire from it. Astonishingly this is no secret, and we as users still willingly hand over our details and personal information.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRecent research reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/28/from-relationships-to-revolutions-seven-ways-facebook-has-changed-the-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; states that most young people are more than willing to hand over information. 91% of users share publicly accessible photos of themselves, 71% post where they live and share their location when updating posts, 61 % of users give their email address away and over a fifth share their mobile number.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know more about strangers than ever before. Years ago personal moments in your life were only shared with your close family and friends, these days that is still true but is also shared with our 500+ network of followers and &#039;friends&#039;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-for-business/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BUSINESSES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has given companies a chance to have a voice when it comes to their brand and a different way to connect and engage with their customers as well as their employees.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial networks enable businesses across the world to amplify their message in a way never thought possible only a decade or two ago.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBusinesses can now respond to customer queries and complaints in real time, with the ability to converse and engage with their customers on a different level which is continually improving as social media companies&rsquo; progress. This in turn is creating a better sense of customer service and brand loyalty among followers.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has proved to be an invaluable tool for businesses who want to grow and connect with their audience.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/dealing-with-disaster-how-social-media-is-helping-save-the-world-1203809&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RESPONSE RATES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe speed of social media has changed the way we learn about and respond to natural disasters. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/01/20/social-media-lessons-haiti/#lQaUkbDj1OkB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;After a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti, non-profits used social media to mobilize &lt;/a&gt;rescue efforts and to support the community. This also saw the deployment of one of the most successful text-to-donate campaigns seen at the time. Similarly, when earthquake and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8379101/Japan-earthquake-how-Twitter-and-Facebook-helped.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tsunami rocked Japan in March 2011&lt;/a&gt;, millions of people around the globe used social media to search for family and friends, as well as get updates on a situation that was very frightening at the time.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMore recently back in April 2015 after the disaster of the Nepal earthquake Facebook reacted quickly by activating a function that allowed those in the vicinity of the disaster to &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/04/26/global-social-media-lifeline-in-nepal-earthquake-aftermath/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mark themselves as &lsquo;safe&rsquo; on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; so that their friends and loved ones we&rsquo;re able to see. Years ago, it was more difficult after a natural disaster such as an earthquake for families and friends to located potentially lost family members, social media has been able to bridge where there was a gap there.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;POLITICS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Watching the returns at 9:45pm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElectionNight?src=hash&quot;&gt;#ElectionNight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/MAGA?src=hash&quot;&gt;#MAGA&lt;/a&gt;???????? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HfuJeRZbod&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HfuJeRZbod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&mdash; Donald J.

At the last election in 2012 there was still a presence especially with candidates using Twitter and Facebook and Youtube. But this year, it was clear to see that the presidential candidates were using social media and it&#039;s influence as a key driver in their campaigns. Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump used Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and pretty much any other social media outlet to influence voters.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-37942842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New methods of prediction&lt;/a&gt; based on data from social media were also used to predict the final results. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brandseye.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrandsEye&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that looks at people&#039;s tweets, correctly predicted both the vote to leave the EU in June&#039;s referendum and a Trump victory in the US election, but how did it do this?&nbsp;The company took a sample of 200,000 tweets. These tweets were then checked by a crowd-sourced army logging in from their homes. Their task was simple; when presented with a tweet, decide if it was pro-Trump or pro-Clinton. As this method was proven successful, and accurate, it&#039;s probable that social media will continue to be used to predict results like these in the future.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;RECRUITMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSocial media has also changed the way in which we as recruiters operate.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLooking back to 10 years ago, recruiters were limited in the ways they could reach out and engage with potential candidates and clients, but thanks to the rise of the internet and mobile devices paired with the growth of social media, it would seem modern day recruiters are now spoilt for choice in the ways they can make contact with potential candidates and clients.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Search:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media outlets have search functionality that allows recruiters to search for people with a particular skills set, job title or people within a particular region. Opening rich talent pools filled with new candidates ready to move into a new role.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt also enables recruiters to search for their clients and stay on top of what they&rsquo;re are up to and engage with the content they may be sharing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; We&#039;ve mentioned about staying up to date on content shared by clients. But social media also gives recruitment agencies the &nbsp;opportunity to share their own thoughts, opinions and expertise to a wider audience through social media channels. Those recruiters that do this may be able to add credibility to their service and set themselves apart &nbsp;from &#039;cowboy&#039; recruiters who can give the industry a bad reputation.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Candidate job searches:&lt;/strong&gt; Content shared by recruiters are often job adverts. An increasing number of candidates are using social media as an outlet to search for jobs. Which makes it a great environment to advertise for roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW HAS SOCIAL MEDIA IMPACTED YOUR LIFE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this blog we have shared just some of the countless ways Social Media has impacted the world we live in.

Job satisfaction will be high as you will become a key part in guiding candidates through the interview process and offering important advice to help them to secure their dream role.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/5kFyAIX8LvZW0CSgg6&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2. WORK WITH GREAT, TALENTED PROFESSIONALS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nI enjoy working with the IT industry because I deal with professionals that care about their careers and where they want to go, and that speak passionately about what they do&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;3. WORK WITH GREAT ORGANISATIONS AND COOL BRANDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe get to work with some great companies. Everyone will look for different things in an organisation, but I like to think we&rsquo;ve got it well-covered across our major client base. We work with award-winning companies, companies that use all the latest and coolest technologies, companies that compare their working environment to Silicon Valley organisations like Facebook or Apple, cool start-ups, and well-established companies that will add some very notable projects to candidates&#039; CVs.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;4. LEARN ABOUT A SPECIFIC MARKET, BECOME AN EXPERT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAt amsource we work with some very talented professionals who know their stuff, and by specialising in one sector of IT we can ensure that we know our stuff too and appear credible when talking about our own individual markets. By developing an expertise in a market, we are able to provide much more of a specialist approach for the IT industry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;272&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/Is1O1TWV0LEJi&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;5. WORK ALONGSIDE A HI-TECH INDUSTRY WHERE YOUR EXPERTISE IS TRULY VALUED.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe work with hi-tech, forward-thinking companies that develop cutting-edge technologies and candidates are grateful to have the opportunity to work with these companies. As experts in our respective markets, we have a proven history of offering advice and guidance in recruitment and our specialist knowledge and advice is valued by clients and candidates alike.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;6. &ldquo;WHAT&rsquo;S IN IT FOR ME?&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHard work doesn&rsquo;t go unrecognised. Besides the monetary rewards, we have incentives in place on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis to continually motivate us, such as lunch, nights out, and holidays. And we get a say in what our incentives should be too!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;7. REAP THE FINANCIAL REWARDS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMoney is one of many reasons why people turn to a career in recruitment, which is why recruitment agencies look for people that are money motivated. Recruitment is very process-driven and if you follow the right processes then you will begin to make frequent placements and see the commission come in.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/mg2Xa0af44fFm&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;8. MEET PEOPLE LIKE YOU.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBecause there is no real clear-cut path into recruitment, you will meet people from all walks of life. At amsource we have Consultants that have graduated in Philosophy, Drama, and Sports Science, but none of that is important as we recruit for the right people. It&rsquo;s important that you demonstrate the core attributes of a recruitment consultant: confidence, tenacity and target-driven to name a few, which means you can guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be surrounded by like-minded individuals, encouraging a great working environment.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;9. FAST-TRACK YOUR CAREER PROGRESSION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nDue to the nature of the business, in order to succeed in recruitment, you have to be ambitious by nature. Ambitious people want to progress and excel their careers, which is often what propels people into a career in recruitment as it will give you the opportunity to fast-track your career and take it in the direction that you want.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;10. FEEL EMPOWERED!&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWorking as a Recruitment Consultant is like owning your own business. We offer a very supportive environment and great training, but how quickly you progress and how successful you become is ultimately up to you.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/111ebonMs90YLu&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere at Amsource Tech, we are always on the look out for hard working people with a &#039;make it happen&#039; attitude to join our growing talented team.

I have a background in Technical Pre-Sales and I have been asked a lot recently, how you can move from an Infrastructure Support focused role, into a Pre-Sales Consultant position. I started my career as a 1st line analyst moving up to 2nd and then 3rd line before moving into Pre-Sales. The key to becoming a successful pre-sales consultant is being able to interact with people both personally and professionally.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Pre-Sales consultant is initially involved to provide the bridge between the Sales professional within your organisation and the end customer who is often a tech-focused IT manager or Architect. You need to be able to work with your Sales team to deliver the best sales pitch, ultimately, they deal with the numbers and you deal with the solution, time frame and customer objectives. Your role is to provide the technical knowledge to these negotiations, offering different solutions for a problem that fit the clients budget and overall objective.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What initially attracted you to pursuing a career in the digital/IT sector?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;I have always loved technology, which started at school. The digital sector was always a booming market and the constant changes in technology allow you to constantly upgrade your knowledge.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What&rsquo;s an average day like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;My role is twofold, Pre-Sales consultancy and post-agreement installations. As mentioned, I bridge the gap between our sales team and the end client to agree a solution, a time frame and the objective of each installation or service. Once signed on the dotted line, I then provide the bridge between the customer and our installation team providing technical knowledge internally and managing expectations externally.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What&rsquo;s your favourite part of the job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;When an install or project is completed and the solution is in place which meets the client&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do you face on day to day basis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Often the client can come into the install discussions with expectations that cannot be delivered, the challenge is to set the clients expectations on budget capabilities, time frames and solutions prior to the install taking place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do you think are most prevalent in the digital sector at the moment and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The most prevalent challenge is often keeping up with the latest technologies and choosing wisely on the type of technology a company you work for supports. If you join a company that requires legacy support, you will soon find that your skills are outdated and limit your opportunities in the future. My advice would be to join a forward-thinking, tech-driven organisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;How has or how will BREXIT impact your role (if at all)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Difficult to forecast, but I do think it would have an impact as some clients I have supported in the past have been European based. Will tech companies relocate their HQ&rsquo;s?! I&rsquo;m not sure at this stage, only time will tell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;As an IT professional, what attracts you to working for an organisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;An ethical, client-driven organisation who is excited by new technology.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What top three tips would you give to someone beginning their career within IT/Pre-Sales?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Concentrate on developing yourself personally. It&#039;s great if an employer will send you on external sources, but you need to be committed to financing certain courses yourself. It will benefit you in the long run&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nPass and share your knowledge with your colleagues, ask for advice.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nExpect to fail but learn from that failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', '', '', 'how-to-make-a-career-move-into-it-pre-sales-', 'yes', 'no', 1578355200);

So here are some reasons why I think you should choose a career in software testing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SOFTWARE TESTING OFFERS A ROUTE FOR PROGRESSION&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s rewarding for many reasons, one of these being because you choose where you want to go. There are various types of testing that you can choose to specialise in, whether that&rsquo;s manual testing, automation testing, performance testing, or a combination of these. Within these, you might find that you really enjoy database testing, or web testing, or GUI testing, etc. &ndash; the list goes on. You may choose to move into more of a leadership role from there on and go down the management route, or you may decide that you&rsquo;re keen to develop yourself technically and expand on your knowledge of hands-on testing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhichever route you choose, there are courses and accreditation&#039;s that will help you in these areas and the roles are clearly defined.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;THE FIELD OF SOFTWARE TESTING IS EVOLVING, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN BE AS TECHNICAL AS YOU WANT TO BE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOur clients look for Testers from all walks of life, but the demand is ever-increasing for Testers that can code and fulfill roles like Automation Tester, Developer in Test, Performance Tester, Penetration/Security Tester, etc. Picking up a new language and improving on your technical skills is a great achievement, whether that&rsquo;s .Net, Java or SQL.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;SOFTWARE TESTERS ARE VALUABLE IN THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAnd what&rsquo;s more rewarding than adding value? Testers are crucial to the development of software. They vet the software for defects, which Developers often miss as they don&rsquo;t have the same eye for detail, and they ensure that the software meets the business and technical requirements. Our clients recognise just how important Testers are and are heavily investing in their test teams, whether that&rsquo;s providing Automation training or helping towards the costs of testing certifications.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nYou will get your hands on Selenium, Cucumber, and other test tools that are all the rage at the moment. We work with companies that apply the best Agile test processes to testing, that develop cloud-based software, and that make the best efforts to continually improve their testing and test processes with the latest technologies and techniques.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;WHY WOULDN&#039;T YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe recruit for testing roles at all levels at Amsource&nbsp;with specialist Consultants that cover permanent and contract vacancies.

Assisting people to widen their connections, learn from their peers and trailblazing companies and offer environments to forge collaborations is vital.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLeeds also have some brilliant initiatives in promoting and nurturing STEM subjects and courses at primary, secondary and higher education; from summer schools, placements, gap-years, workplace outreach and apprenticeships.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGvOS0HnNpQ&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Deb Hetherington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/deb%20hetherington.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDeb&rsquo;s work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/&quot;&gt;Leeds Beckett University&lt;/a&gt; impacts the digital sector in the North in a range of ways, from sizeable knowledge transfer partnerships with large scale projects, right through to working with digital start-up companies offering the full spectrum of university services.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nDeb&rsquo;s main project is a European funded programme &lt;a href=&quot;https://ad-venture.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;called Ad:venture&lt;/a&gt;, which offers digital start-up companies assistance in marketing, business planning, app development, mentoring, workshops, funding and more. Deb is able to meet with companies interested in the programme and run through a full diagnostic of their business in order to gauge where they are now, where they are aiming to be, and what their barriers to growth are. She can then create a business support programme for them made up of the services listed above.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere&rsquo;s what Deb has to say about the exciting digital landscape in The North at the moment &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;The digital sector in the North is a really exciting place to be at the moment, particularly in Leeds. There is so much going on, and the best part is how collaborative we are as a city &ndash; with such collaboration and partnership potential the opportunities are endless. It&rsquo;s also great to see so many female leaders in tech here, people who are flying the flag for diversity and are equally bloody good at their jobs; Zandra Moore CEO of Panintelligence, Natasha Sayce-Zelem head of tech at Sky, Tanja Lichtensteiger Engineering Manager of Sky Bet to name but a few. There is a strong network of women in tech in the North, who also provide mentorship for young women coming through education who want to work in digital. Educating the next generation is hugely important in order to maintain our position on the digital map and retain the talent our university&rsquo;s are churning out.&ldquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kicking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leedsbeckett?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@leedsbeckett&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/digitalshiftsummit18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#digitalshiftsummit18&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HalifaxUBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HalifaxUBC&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ribbitmedia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ribbitmedia&lt;/a&gt; talking about their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ADVENTURE_LCR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ADVENTURE_LCR&lt;/a&gt; journey.

The idea stemmed from Anna&rsquo;s frustration at getting insight from data within the organisations she was was working for. Anna and Ed discussed and decided they wanted to build a product that could help non-technical people process and analyse their own data sources. Their determination to be self-funded meant they had to find money from somewhere and so the consultancy was born!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere&rsquo;s what she has to say about running her own business and being a female leader, &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a dull day running your own business. Learning to lead &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; in a totally new industry has been an immense challenge (particularly juggling alongside motherhood). Most fulfilling has been building a brilliant team and making sure we have an environment that lets us all thrive.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAnna is active in the Leeds Digital community and can often be found speaking at regular local events including Ladies of Code and was recently on the Panel of the Leeds event of the Tech Nation tour.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Natasha Sayce-Zelem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Natasha%20Sayce-Zelem.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/natashazelem-634b369/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natasha Sayce-Zelem&lt;/a&gt; is Head of Technology at Sky and has been named one of the UK&rsquo;s Top 100 Women working in technology right now.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNatasha is also the founder of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/technology-event-in-leeds-will-encourage-more-women-to-take-up-careers-in-stem-1-9376132&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Empowering Women with Science and Tech&lt;/a&gt; movement in Leeds.&nbsp; The movement is working to showcase inspiring role models working in Science, digital and Technology, in a way to support and attract more women in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjgajBOjDyE&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Tanja Lichtensteiger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Tanja%20Lichtensteiger.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 400px; height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/a-q-and-a-with-tanja-lichtensteiger-of-sky-betting-and-gaming-81865940311&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tanja&lt;/a&gt; is Engineering Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skybetcareers.com/about-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sky Betting and Gaming&lt;/a&gt; in Leeds.

We have demonstrated that, not only do we have a validated system for tracking diet, but also that this can lead to better health outcomes for patients and is supported by health care professionals.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'northern tech female tech leaders', '', '21-female-tech-leaders-flying-the-flag-for-northern-tech-', 'yes', 'no', 1546300800),

Things that were in comprehendible twenty years ago are now considered the norm and a part of our everyday life.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs our exposure to digital enhancements increases there is growing scepticism in society about how much of a good thing all this new technology is, and suggestions that this &lsquo;friend&rsquo; in technology we&rsquo;ve welcomed into our lives is actually our foe.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe know about the benefits of technology. We know we&rsquo;re better connected, we know healthcare has improved, and we can see that the world feels like a &lsquo;smaller&rsquo; place because of advances in transport tech, among so many other things.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;So what&rsquo;s the cause for concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;ve wrote blogs in the past about suggestions that technology is actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/is-technology-dumbing-us-down--52372516102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lsquo;dumbing us down&rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, and that we are more reliant on technology to do things for us rather than taking the time to find the answer ourselves (which we would have done years before). In other words it&rsquo;s making us lazy.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere&rsquo;s fears about the negative effect this &lsquo;over exposure to technology&rsquo; is having on our children. In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/digital-education-for-or-against--53384104451&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; we discussed how many Silicon Valley parents are now opting to send their children to schools where there is little or no technology with reports that children who attend schools with a heavy influence of technology do not perform as well as those children who are exposed to a more traditional (tech-free) style of learning.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThere&rsquo;s the issue of automation. How advances in technology has the potential cause an increase in unemployment in the future as technology is developed to carry out the tasks a human worker would. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/the-rise-of-automation-to-cause-an-increase-in-unemployment--62727105030&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more here.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNot to mention the concerns that as our global population continues to rise, technology advancements will put considerable pressure on our resources and economy, which could cause a domino effect of issues.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhich leads us to ask&hellip;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Can technology really deliver a sustainable future for planet earth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; We recently attended the &lt;a href=&quot;http://10bn.sheffield.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sheffield festival of 10 billion&lt;/a&gt;, held at The University of Sheffield (15th &ndash; 18th February 2016).&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHow will we live in a world of 10 billion?

The debate also looked to explore the issues that flow from our technological relations and how we can manage them in alternate ways in a world of 10bn.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27208569&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Our demand for energy - and the life enhancing technologies it powers - has led to the plundering of the earth&#039;s hydrocarbons oil, gas and coal, ultimately leading to potentially catastrophic climate change.&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;The key question leading the debate was &lsquo;if technology got us into this mess can we trust it to get us out?&rsquo; &hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was really interesting to hear the various views surrounding these topics. The prime take away for us was that yes technology will be an important element in sustaining our planet as our population grows to 10 billion however, investment into development of green technology will be key as climate change continues to be a pressing issue.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies are still reluctant to see the value of turning green.

At the moment approximately 15% of CO2 emissions come from cars alone.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nMany attendees asked can we trust the technologists to help us in this quest for sustainability in what seems to be such a profit hungry market?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;d love to get your views on this as well.

At the start, it all felt like a nice simple project, Antony has always bought vintage items as a trader and asked for my help in building a website for him so that he could cover more of the country. What we didn&rsquo;t know is that within 3 years we&rsquo;d be filling 34,000 sq ft building and launching in the Netherlands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;It&rsquo;s fair to say the journey has been incredibly &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_155 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;155&quot; id=&quot;155&quot;&gt;eye opening&lt;/g&gt; for us as founders. Along the way we&rsquo;ve hit the usual milestones for start-ups, such as getting our first 1,000 customers, soon followed by 1,000 Trustpilot reviews, generating our first &pound;100k in revenue, and then reaching our first million, but it hasn&rsquo;t all been rosy! Hiring before focussing on efficiencies inflated our overheads and like a lot of start-ups we almost ran out of money, but we&rsquo;ve learned invaluable lessons along the way, and being around the right people is where we&rsquo;ve learned the most.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/4_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have secured funding from &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_158 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;158&quot; id=&quot;158&quot;&gt;Dutch&lt;/g&gt; Founders Fund, which also includes VC Airbridge and some other very successful Dutch entrepreneurs. What have these partnerships enabled you to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;re fortunate enough to have a team that includes the Co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.just-eat.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Just Eat&lt;/a&gt; and Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.treatwell.co.uk/&quot;&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_156 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;156&quot; id=&quot;156&quot;&gt;Treatwell&lt;/g&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; Laurens Groenendijk, the Founder of SpaceBuzz Foundation, Hidde Hoogcarspel, the Founder and CEO of SoConnect, Daan Donders, and the Founder of WeTransfer, Bas Beerens, as well as three others who all have a role in supporting us. Their motivation, enthusiasm and vision &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_159 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;159&quot; id=&quot;159&quot;&gt;has&lt;/g&gt; been the real catalyst to our growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;One of the biggest impacts has been for us to start seeing things bigger. They have instilled a far greater sense of what is possible with Vintage Cash Cow and we meet with the team regularly to discuss next steps, which helped us maintain focus on what will really make a difference.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With their support, we&rsquo;ve just launched a new B2C site in the Netherlands and our brand-new fundraising brand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintagegiving.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VintageGiving.com&lt;/a&gt;, is now live. We&rsquo;re also in talks with two of the top five Dutch charities to help build them white label versions of the VintageGiving platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/1_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why have you chosen to grow your business here in Leeds?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antony has always lived here, just north of Chapel Allerton, and when deciding where to have the warehouse, it had to be in the city centre. Now that we&rsquo;ve been hiring digital and tech roles, we&rsquo;ve really seen the benefit to being located here and we&rsquo;re looking forward to doing more to collaborate with the tech community here in Leeds, with the expectation of more growth team hires throughout the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;With our growth into the Netherlands, another nice bonus is Leeds Bradford airport - we are door-to-door with our investors in Amsterdam in around three hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mention that the tech community is an attractive aspect to being based in Leeds, how do you as a business engage with the tech community in Leeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engaging with the tech community in Leeds is very important to us. In previous years, we&rsquo;d used mostly Dutch freelancers as we were unable to commit to &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;163&quot; id=&quot;163&quot;&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_161 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;161&quot; id=&quot;161&quot;&gt;full&lt;/g&gt; time&lt;/g&gt; in-house positions, but we&rsquo;re in a very different position now. We&rsquo;re now &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_162 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;162&quot; id=&quot;162&quot;&gt;focussed&lt;/g&gt; on creating more tech and digital jobs in Leeds this year, which will not only benefit the tech ecosystem here in Leeds but it will also be central to enabling our business to scale and grow as we progress with our roadmap of expansion into the Netherlands, Germany, and with the large charity deals that we have brewing.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re currently in talks with one of the coding competitions at Leeds Digital Festival for sponsorship, which will be a great opportunity to showcase our product, growth and hiring roadmap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/2_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you use Technology to drive your business? And why is Technology important to your business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The backbone of our operation is the CRM platform that we&rsquo;ve built over the last 3 years. With a few adjustments, we&rsquo;re now using it to manage a retail focussed service for 380 Age UK stores. Last week we replicated the platform, made a few more changes and it&rsquo;s now ready for the Netherlands.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We rely on technology to handle each lead, from cradle to grave, with triggered emails, SMS messages, phone calls and letters. Our appraisals tool allows us to store the customer journey of each box that gets sent it, its contents, and the appraised price. With our launch into the Netherlands, it means that the team will be able to easily get second opinions from our core team of senior experts in the UK on higher value boxes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;To sell in the volumes we do, we&#039;ve built our own selling platform. Currently, it publishes the items onto eBay, but soon it will also list on other marketplaces too. eBay isn&#039;t designed for high volume sellers where every item is unique, so we built our own way of doing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;While the team has grown from 7 to 12 in the last year, the revenue that the department produces each month has grown by over 300%, so internal communication and visibility over what&rsquo;s happening &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_130 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;130&quot; id=&quot;130&quot;&gt;is&lt;/g&gt; vital. We push data from various sources to create focussed dashboards for each team and ensure that everyone&rsquo;s working together to reach targets.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/3_2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a champion for Tech4Good, what initiatives do you have planned for 2019 related to this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;re in talks with a number of big charities to white label our service - taking all our learnings from the last 3 years and creating for them, their very own version of what we do. We handle everything for them, the customer service, handling boxes, the buying and the selling.&nbsp;The charity has a new site to promote as a fundraising tool - especially helpful for ones that do not have retail outlets to accept goods and sell them on.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Our &quot;Vintech&quot; approach to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_140 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;140&quot; id=&quot;140&quot;&gt;re-commerce&lt;/g&gt;&lt;em&gt; is scooping up millions of pounds worth of old and unused vintage items. We don&#039;t target the people who sell on eBay; instead, our ads attract the people who are time-poor and want rid. The stuff we buy would have sat in homes for decades to come. Its next destination would likely be a landfill but instead, people are turning their old stuff into a few quid to spend, helping towards the bills or a treat for themselves, and ensuring there is zero waste.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve received and sold on vast amounts of vintage items to fuel the second-hand marketplace. We give people far more second-hand buying options on eBay so they buy less brand new items. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;In the last year, we&#039;ve sold:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2.8 tonnes of costume jewellery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2,000 old clocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4,000 fountain pens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;40,000 watches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;7,000 cameras&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;25 tonnes of scrap metal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;and so much other stuff!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We provide a Circular economy; whilst 10 different peoples&#039; broken pocket watches aren&#039;t much use on their own, we amalgamate these job lots and sell them on to worldwide traders, helping them with their needs for old spares and repairs parts. In the last year, we&#039;ve sold to people in over 80 countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;re providing charity shops with a new revenue stream - once they&#039;ve tried to sell an item in their store, they then box it up to sell to us. Age UK uses us in all 380 shops, and we&#039;re working with 15 hospices and an additional 150 charity shops so far.&nbsp; We collect boxes of items from their shops free of charges and within 48 hours, we&#039;ve posted them out a cheque.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We learned that some charity shop managers let local traders pay 5p per kilo for the non-precious scrap metals they receive such as brass, copper, pewter and silver plate.&nbsp; We promise to pay them well in excess of &pound;1 per kilo for most non-precious metals, a huge increase for them, helping them to make more money. We also help&nbsp;charities raise money from the &quot;unsalables&quot;, which some shops aren&rsquo;t allowed to sell. These include military weapons, furs, smoking pipes, razors, wine and champagne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&#039;ve now got the green light to start work on a white-label solution with one of the world&#039;s largest charities, currently operating in over 190 countries. We&#039;re building them their own branded version of our service, powered by our charity brand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vintagegiving.com/&quot;&gt;Vintage Giving&lt;/a&gt;. It would otherwise be far too costly for this charity to raise donations via supporters vintage items, but we&#039;ve now made it possible and we&#039;re excited to see what 2019 will bring!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/File.ashx?path=Root/Images/david_anthony_vcc.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 700px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vintage Cash Cow &lt;g class=&quot;gr_ gr_114 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace&quot; data-gr-id=&quot;114&quot; id=&quot;114&quot;&gt;have&lt;/g&gt; been shortlisted at the 2019 Leeds Digital Festival Awards (taking place on 30th April at Headrow House) in the Growth Company of the Year category.

The platform revolutionising the Tuition world. Here, founders Mark and Scott tell us more about how they got their idea off of the ground, challenges they have faced, achievements and plans for the future. Read more below...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First off here&#039;s little bit about the founders...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.linkedin.com/in/scott-woodley-495010bb&quot;&gt;Scott Woodley: COO &amp; Co-Founder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nScott began his career in Sheffield and graduated from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;with a Masters in Law. From here, Scott went on to become a primary school teacher, and after a period of consideration left to become a private tutor. Being greatly oversubscribed in that role, he came up with the idea for Tutorful to provide a trusted network of local tutors.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-hughes-91b2601b/ &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Hughes: CEO &amp; Co-Founder&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nHaving studied Structural Engineering at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cam.ac.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, Mark went on the spend several years as a Technology Analyst in the finance industry working for a large investment firm in Edinburgh. Mark taught himself to code in his spare time, which became a great asset during the early days of founding Tutorful.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What initially sparked the idea to start the Tutorful venture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Tutorful started in response to problems that Scott faced in his role as a Primary school teacher and then as a tutor. It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that schools are feeling the pressure of substantial austerity cuts, increased class sizes and tumultuous changes to the curriculum, at a time where the future job market is sizing up to be unpredictable and hugely competitive. The effects of which are felt on teachers and students alike.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a teacher Scott was asked by many parents to recommend a private tutor, wanting to ensure that their children were given the best opportunities to succeed. It was difficult to be able to recommend tutors that were reliable, local, qualified, and that weren&rsquo;t oversubscribed. Eventually leaving his teaching role to become a tutor, these issues were something that Scott continued to struggle with. Being inundated with requests for help resulted in Scott establishing a network of local tutors - the early days of what would become Tutorful.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWith a high tuition workload and struggling to take more students on, Scott was able to refer that work to other tutors trusted tutors in his local network. With Mark&rsquo;s input the idea snowballed, and they started the process of building Tutorful, an online marketplace connecting parents with tutors. Parents could browse and review the profiles of top-quality tutors, who were specialists at teaching their individual subject areas, at the relevant level and were of close geographical proximity to their students.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us more about Tutorful, what it does and who it is aimed at?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Tutorful connects parents across the UK with the very best private tutors for their children, bringing transparency to an industry that has previously lacked in trust, openness, clarity and security.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe operate as a marketplace that helps parents to find the best local tutors for one-to-one tuition, either face to face, or via our innovative online classroom. With over 10,000 tutors covering 300+ subjects, and catering for early years all the way up to PhD level, site users can freely browse and review profiles of top-quality tutors based on subject area, level and proximity to their post code.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nFor tutors, Tutorful provides an opportunity to advance their private tuition businesses. Tutors no longer need to rely on ads in the Yellow Pages or signs in shop windows - Tutorful helps them to create detailed and beautiful profiles showcasing their qualifications, subject expertise, academic history and personality, which are advertised to thousands of potential students every week. The platform then supports Tutors to manage communication with potential students, arrange locations and times to meet, and then handles all payment transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Being a growing start-up business, what challenges have you encountered so far and how have you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Going from a 2 person startup, to company that now employs 30 members of staff is not without its challenges. The biggest identifiable challenge to starting Tutorful has been facilitating the successful scale up. Scaling up and increasing growth rests fundamentally on the ability to communicate those aspirations to an ever increasing team, and effectively prioritise interdepartmentally.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt was a challenge to move on from only having to consider a very small number of roles within the company, to setting up departments with niche specialisms. Our rapid and sustained growth has meant we had to rethink the way our team worked, and subsequently systems were implemented that gave ownership and responsibility to the departments.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You were one of the proud winners at last year&rsquo;s Northern Stars Grand Final. How did you find the Northern Stars process? And how has it helped the growth of Tutorful so far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Northern Stars was a fantastic competition to be involved in and we were delighted to be named as one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsourcetechnology.com/news/northern-stars-grand-final-2017-73252111512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;top 10 startups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe process itself was hugely enjoyable, from meeting local founders during the regional finals to having the opportunity to introduce the business to a large new audience. During the events which have followed, we&#039;ve gained further press coverage and had lots of opportunities to learn from new connections made.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAs a founder, the most enjoyable and useful result is getting to know other founders, who you can turn to discuss shared problems. We&#039;ve been fortunate enough to get guidance on hiring and marketing, as well as being able to share what we learn about building a happy, successful team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErtNFkIkEwA&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What would your advice be to other start-up businesses looking to get their business off the ground?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Prioritisation of resources and where to place your focus is key at the initial startup phase and continues once you move into growth. As a new business owner there will always be a million and one things you could be doing or thinking about, so setting out a clear roadmap for the business and prioritising where your energy goes is super important. This also allows you to iterate rapidly on new ideas or initiatives which have the potential to scale upwards without getting bogged down with details or becoming overencumbered with too much at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What do you think are the biggest barriers are in terms of growth for start-ups at the moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;From our experience growing Tutorful, we&rsquo;ve personally experienced a couple of barriers for startup growth that can be a real struggle to overcome. First is the intense saturation of new businesses across so many industries. Consumers are spoilt for choice like never before so the challenge here is in building brand loyalty and giving consumers a fantastic reason to keep coming back, rather than switching around between whoever&rsquo;s offering them the best opportunity in that given moment. Those startups who solve the challenge of customer churn and keeping their retention rates high are sure to see improved, and faster, rates of growth.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe second hurdle is the lure of the capital. So many of the big-tech companies and up-and-comers are based in and around London, meaning the lion&#039;s share of tech-talent and investment opportunity naturally gravitates there too. This is one we&rsquo;re still figuring out, but something we&rsquo;re definitely seeing is a growing sense of loyalty to the North and the burgeoning tech scene here from everyone involved in its development.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;re based in Sheffield. What is it about Sheffield that makes it a great destination for tech start-ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Sheffield is a fantastic city for all sorts of startups, not just those operating within the tech sector. There&rsquo;s a flourishing entrepreneurial scene here supported by a host of great local businesses, two brilliant universities and networks like Sheffield Digital and Startup Weekend. Being in close proximity to Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle also connects Sheffield directly with other northern startup hubs, with easy access to their networks and talent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;What would you have liked to achieve by the end of 2018 at Tutorful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;We&rsquo;ve got ambitious plans for the remainder of 2018! Alongside maintaining our fantastic growth trajectory, we&rsquo;re releasing our first mobile apps, designed to help our tutors manage their lesson bookings, schedules and earnings more easily.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe&rsquo;re also working on enhancing our online tuition offering. There are huge benefits to moving traditional face-to-face services like tuition into a digital format - reduced operating costs and zero travel for tutors, instant access to learning materials like past papers and video content, and of course the ability for students to review recordings of their sessions to aid with revision. As digital transformation evolves, we&rsquo;re making sure to be at the forefront of its place in the tuition industry over the coming years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nFollow more of the Tutorful journey over at their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TutorfulGB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter page here&lt;/a&gt;.

With the Java Developers being highly sought after, organisations are willing to &ldquo;pay out&rdquo; for outstanding developers.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen thinking about what you can do with Java there are a few common things that come up. application servers, web applications, mobile and desktop application, enterprise applications and cloud-based applications.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nYou can find these in any company using java but I wanted to take a look into some other ways it is currently being used.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;We Have Lift Off..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/6yWV529bDk3WU&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNasa are always creating interesting new products and are using Java for a number of Java for some interesting applications.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTheir World Wind product uses Java,&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Wind&lt;/a&gt; allows users to zoom in form outer space and examine any locations.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nJava has also been used to develop NASA mission software, that has been used in various Space missions.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dude, where&rsquo;s my car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;giphy-embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; src=&quot;https://giphy.com/embed/j6cvcVqIpekW4&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nSelf-driving cars are becoming more of a reality.

(75, 'Becoming a Future Proof Developer...', 0, '', '', '1d8e1a8b0fda664990e1c8fb295ab9f2.png', '&lt;h2&gt;In this blog our digital specialist David highlights some of the languages he thinks will enable developers to &quot;future proof&quot; their skill set in coming years...&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technical landscape is changing, gone are the days of companies just choosing between traditional programming languages such as Java, C# and PHP. These languages still play a fundamental role in Software Development but now we are seeing an emergence of different programming languages, frameworks and technologies that are disrupting the industry. This article will you show what the emerging languages are so you can stay ahead of the trend. There will be languages that I have missed as I could have gone on forever, however I am open to hearing what languages should be on here and your reasons why. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nAlso known as Golang, Go was 2016&rsquo;s programming language of the year according to the Tiobe index. It was created back in 2009 by three google employees &ndash; Rob Greismere, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Go creators say &lt;em&gt;&ldquo;Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of statically typed, compiled language&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLeading tech teams and renowned companies such as the BBC, eBay, Facebook, Netflix and the award winning Gov.uk site all use Golang.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Google Go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Producing maintainable code&lt;/strong&gt; - Standardised formatting and naming through tooling (gofmt, lint) and minimalistic language makes it easy to read and reason.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concurrency&lt;/strong&gt; - Go uses coroutines called goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Communication between goroutines is done very elegantly using channels.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt also offers excellent Performance and Scalability.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe name Scala is an acronym for &lsquo;Scalable Language&rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nScala has been established for a little longer than some of the other up and coming emerging languages with its initial release in 2004.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe creator of Scala Martin Odersky developed the language because he was frustrated with some of the restrictions of Java.&lt;br /&gt;\nHe went on to say &ldquo;Scala was designed to show that a fusion of functional and object-oriented programming is possible and practical. That&rsquo;s still its primary role.&rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBecause of this big tech giants are choosing Scala with it been used for development by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netflix.com/gb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwir6pvHhcXVAhVLte0KHaGKBk0YABAAGgJkZw&amp;ohost=www.google.co.uk&amp;cid=CAASEuRoe4cTqHaP1IM4ICRQ5TK1Fg&amp;sig=AOD64_3HXuZY_p8OB7EuilgxyhHXGN-mGg&amp;q=&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMxpfHhcXVAhUiK8AKHejWC7oQ0QwIJw&amp;adurl=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Scala?&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen describing the benefits of Scala it is easiest to compare it to Java (Scala is sometimes referred to as Java&rsquo;s cousin).&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nIt&rsquo;s functional: The elimination of mutation from application code allows the application to be run in parallel across hosts and cores without any deadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Better concurrency model&lt;/strong&gt; - Scala has an Actor model that is said to be better than Java&#039;s model of locks on a thread.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concise code -&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;Scala code is more concise than its more verbose cousin, Java.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Type safety/static typing &lt;/strong&gt;- Scala does type checking at compile time.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/strong&gt; - The case statements in Scala are super powerful.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance&lt;/strong&gt; - The mixing traits are great, and they definitely reduce code repetition.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Domain-specific language (DSL)&lt;/strong&gt; - Scala syntax allows for a programmer to write a natural looking DSL. This ability was carefully built into the original language design. This is a very powerful feature of Scala. Scala test/specs build on top of this feature.&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://clojure.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nLaunched in 2009, Clojure is another dialect of Lisp programming language.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe creator Rich Hickey described Clojure as &ldquo;Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic &ndash; every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.&rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt is successfully used in industry by renowned companies including Walmart, Puppet labs, Amazon and Salesforce to name a few.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Clojure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Concurrency -&lt;/strong&gt; It offers immutable data structures, functional programming with zero side-effects, Software Transaction Memory built in, etc. You can focus your engineering efforts on features instead of concurrency details.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nLazy data structures are built-in - you can focus more on writing uncomplicated code than on performance tuning and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;\nQuicker Development - the interactive REPL makes development quicker and more fun. It also dramatically speeds up the learning process.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nRust was created by Mozilla, Rust 1.0 was released in 2014, having been in development for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nClose in some respects to C and C++, Mozilla describes it as a &ldquo;new programming language which focuses on performance, parallelisation, and memory safety&rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nTo design and implement a safe, concurrent, practical systems language.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nRust exists because other languages at this level of abstraction and efficiency are unsatisfactory. In particular:&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There is too little attention paid to safety.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They have poor concurrency support.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There is a lack of practical affordances.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They offer limited control over resources.&lt;br /&gt;\n&bull;&lt;span style=&quot;white-space: pre;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Rust exists as an alternative that provides both efficient code and a comfortable level of abstraction, while improving on all four of these points.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe Stack Overflow survey released recently found Rust to be the most beloved among developers of all programming languages and frameworks.&lt;br /&gt;\nRust is used by companies such as Chef, Samsung and Dropbox.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Rust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTesting: Built in support for testing saves you time and brings consistency.&lt;br /&gt;\nMaintenance: Most of the issues that crop up once the code is shipped such as invalid index, dangling pointer, memory corruption and resource leak. Rust eliminates almost all of these, and more. So in most cases the bugs you would need to fix would be related to actual business logic.&lt;br /&gt;\nSpeed: The goal of Rust is to be as fast as C++. While not quite there yet, it is close&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nKotlin v1.0 was released in February 2016 by JetBrains, the maker of the world&rsquo;s best IDEs.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe head of JetBrains Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compile time of Scala as an obvious deficiency. One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java.&lt;br /&gt;\nWith Kotlin, JetBrains fixes most of the annoyances of Java, while keeps complete compatibility with its parent language (kotlin can interact with java code and vice-versa).. Basically, you can view Kotlin as Java, that doesn&#039;t suffer from NullPointerExceptions and Checked Exceptions, has better generics and refined syntax that heavily relies on type inference, so you don&#039;t have to manually point type info in the most of cases. Also, it has lot of modern niceties like extension functions, first-class functions, (simple) operator overloading and quite a few more cool things that make life of every developer easier.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies using Kotlin include Uber, Pinterest and Atlassian.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn Kotlin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nImproves productivity - by reducing the effort needed to write code. For example, a 50 lines (approx.) code written in Java can be reduced to 2/3 (approx.) lines in Kotlin.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Quick code compilation -&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Reduces learning time for developers by providing documentation and support.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Syntax is easy to understand&lt;/strong&gt; - so the code review is simple even for a newcomer.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Runtime overhead is low&lt;/strong&gt; as the standard library is small and compact.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThe next suggestions are not languages, they are Javascript related tools and technologies. These are becoming more and more sought after as the &ldquo;full-stack Developer&rdquo; is becoming the norm.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Node.js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js is a runtime system for creating (mostly) server-side applications. It&#039;s best known as a popular means for JavaScript coders to build real-time Web APIs. JavaScript has historically been used for client-side so this is why Node is different.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js has become one of the foundational elements of the &quot;JavaScript everywhere&quot; paradigm allowing web application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nNode.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in 2009 Dahl was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr. The browser did not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the Web server. Dahl desired an easier way&lt;br /&gt;\nDahl criticized the limited possibilities of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most common way of creating code (sequential programming), when code either blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the case of simultaneous connections.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nCompanies including PayPal and even NASA are using Node.js in production.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Why learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Asynchronous&lt;/strong&gt; - It&#039;s built to handle asynchronous I/O from the ground up and is a good match to a lot of common web- and network-development problems. &nbsp;In addition to fast JavaScript execution, the real magic behind Node.js is called the Event Loop. To scale to large volumes of clients, all I/O intensive operations in Node.js are performed asynchronously.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Javascript&lt;/strong&gt; - Node.js is Javascript. &nbsp;So the same language can be used on the backend and frontend. &nbsp; This means it breaks down the boundaries between front- and back-end development.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Community Driven&lt;/strong&gt; - In addition to its innate capabilities, Node.js has a thriving open source community which has produced many excellent modules to add additional capabilities to Node.js applications. One of the most famous is Socket.io, a module to manage persistent connections between client and server, enabling the server to push real-time updates to clients.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nOne thing we can take away from this is that a lot of the new languages are created with the aim of removing the annoyances from established programming languages. At the moment if you had no development experience and were to ask what language would I recommend you should learn I would still recommend learning at least one of the mainstream programming languages (Java, C#, PHP, Ruby etc). However we are increasingly seeing some of these languages adopted within companies in the area. Some of the big players in the North of England are developing in Golang, Scala and Kotlin with many more likely to follow suit.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWhat are your thoughts? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmsourceTech&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tweet us @AmsourceTech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'future proof developer', '', 'becoming-a-future-proof-developer-', 'yes', 'no', 1546300800);

(76, 'Top Software Testing Trends for 2016', 0, '', '', 'ec25bd57054a77cf248a6071f9f27f8b.png', '&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s been a busy start to 2016 and we have already seen a lot of movement in technology. As the demand for a more &ldquo;technical&rdquo; Tester increases, so does the importance for a Tester to keep an eye on trends in technology as this will undoubtedly have an impact on expectations for Testers to up-skill in certain areas in order to stay ahead of the competition.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nHere is what I think will be the most important trends for Software Testers in 2016.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Automation Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nTest Automation has advanced significantly in recent years with the availability of popular opensource tools like Selenium Webdriver and SoapUI, providing an opportunity for Testers to create robust and efficient test frameworks. This will undoubtedly continue to grow in 2016, as I predict that companies will begin to see Test Automation as a necessity rather than a luxury.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Mobile Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this digital age, companies have had no option but to embrace the rise of mobile technology. This, along with the on-going birth of digital agencies and the uprising of software houses specialising in mobile technologies, means that we will notice a significant impact on software testing as the demand for functional, performance, usability and compatibility testing on these mobile applications increase. We are already seeing an increase in demand for specialist Mobile Application Testers, and as we know, the natural progression for manual methods of testing can only lead to Test Automation, which means we will ultimately see mobile automation as an ensuing trend. Testers can expect to see an increase in demand for skills in mobile automation tools, such as Appium. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;3. More Agile, More Dev-Ops&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nThe increasing adoption of an Agile approach has brought Developers and Testers together and has seen more and more organisations embracing Dev-ops practices in order to speed up deliverables. Testers in 2016 can expect to see testing in an Agile environment as a continuous trend and testing in a Dev-ops environment as an emerging trend.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;4. Big Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nBig data is one of many buzzwords in technology right now, slowly rising in popularity over the last few years as companies realise the benefit of analysing complex sets of data to discover information that could help them to make better decisions. If you shop on Amazon, you will have noticed that your buying patterns and previous searches on their website will influence their product suggestions for you on your next visit. Data testing is already quite a niche skill set and an area where there&rsquo;s a skills gap in testing, and as this trend peaks and more companies buy into the hype, Testers will be expected to pick up specialist skills in testing big data solutions. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThis is just what I think but I&rsquo;d love to hear others&rsquo;opinions. What do you think will influence the testing community this year?

(78, 'Three Ways To Maintain Company Culture Whilst Working Remotely', 0, '', '', '4b15ba8fdf525daa0ff9a07361f24512.png', '&lt;p&gt;Culture and atmosphere are central to the success of any business. While they may be intangible factors, there is little doubting just how much impact the happiness and fulfilment of a workforce can have on results and group wins.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With so many companies and industries as a whole now forced to work remotely, how does a business go about maintaining that culture while their employees are no longer under the same roof? With so much hard work and time having gone in to developing and instilling the core tenants of these shared philosophies, does that all get forgotten when the constant contact that reinforces it is removed?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Having worked with many fully-remote businesses, both before and during the current Covid-19 pandemic, there are measures that can be taken to keep that familiarity and rapport alive, to make the eventual transition back in to our normal working lives and environments that bit easier.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create group oppertunities for employees to get together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Get%20Together.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your usual working day included frequent team progress meetings, they shouldn&rsquo;t be forgotten about while working remotely - sharing updates on how your day has been or what you&rsquo;ve got planned can open up regular avenues of conversation and collaboration, which can reinforce that group mentality and help teams feel less apart. Away from purely work focused exchanges, if you&rsquo;re the type of social company who enjoy regular Friday drinks or have a lunch club set up, try and replace that with an interactive online activity to get everyone enjoying themselves together again - here at Amsource, for example, our Friday beers have been replaced with a Friday quiz via Edison, with the whole team participating!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help your employees feel as comfortable WFH as possible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Work%20From%20Home.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same small details that make all the difference in the office are just as important - if not even more so - when working remotely. You should ensure that your employees not only have the right tools to perform their role to the best of their abilities to their disposal, but are comfortable using them at home. In the office, we ensure we have the right desks, chairs, monitor positions, ergonomic keyboards and mice - that same attention to detail should remain for remote employees, especially during such an extended period away from the office. Another touch to consider is company branded merchandise to make them feel a sense of belonging from home - mouse mats, stationary and hoodies are a great place to start.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage communication, and celebrate successes together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://amsource.io/app/data/tmp/images/Icons_Encourage%20Communication.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 250px; height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most offices will actively encourage colleagues to speak about work as often as possible - discussing ongoing tasks, seeking wider views and opinions, informal exchanges about challenges and obstacles. Having that support system to hand is one of the hardest things to replace and replicate in a remote environment. In order to combat this, teams should be equipped with as much communication software as possible, with instant messaging and video calls far more attractive than emails or picking up the phone. When one of the team has a win, this should be celebrated by all as it would be in the office, to reinforce a sense of togetherness and collective success.Need any help with setting your team up remotely?&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to continue recruiting but unsure of how to scale your business in a fully remote manner?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amsource.io/contact-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; with Amsource to find out more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Three Ways To Maintain Company Culture Whilst Working Remotely', '', 'How to adapt your company dynamic during the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure your company culture remains whilst working remotely', 'three-ways-to-maintain-company-culture-whilst-working-remotely', 'yes', 'no', 1591747200),

For those businesses who want to reintroduce the office environment into their regular working pattern, here are some essential steps to consider where employee safety is concerned.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don&rsquo;t rush back to being fully office based&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s more than one reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t rush straight back in to being fully office based, and both are as legitimate as the other. Firstly, with safety in mind, having a defined split between when the office is opened and when it isn&rsquo;t reduces the chance of transmission should the virus find itself inside your staff bubble. Additionally, based on statistics taken from an industry wide survey conducted by Amsource, the overwhelming sentiment within the industry is that a permanent adoption of some form of remote working should be under real consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit numbers in communal areas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kitchens, toilets, meeting rooms &ndash; any and all confined spaces should have clearly defined capacities established, and ideally a one in one out policy in place. Being in close proximity to others vastly heightens the likelihood of transmission, so these encounters should be completely avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restrict congestion with one-way systems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than having people come and go from the main office area as they please &ndash; which is fine under normal circumstances &ndash; if possible, set up a dedicated door that can be used as an entry point and another to exit, defining which direction people should move through the office to avoid loitering and crowding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide sanitiser and promote hygiene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of regular hand washing and good general hygiene, providing staff with hand sanitiser at all entrances and exits - as well as their own bottle on their desk &ndash; allows them to combat any bacteria they may have on their hands at regular intervals. This kind of preventative and proactive measure will make staff feel safer and cared for, which will ease their transition back into the office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take employees individual circumstances into account&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not every employee may be able to commit to coming back into the office at this stage, and that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue if they have a valid reason to remain remote. Those who have underlying illnesses, have family at home they&rsquo;re caring for or don&rsquo;t want to risk exposing vulnerable members of their family to the virus inadvertently should all have their concerns heard and understood. Childcare is also a concern for the parents amongst your staff, and with schools remaining closed, that may be another telling factor.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ready to change your businesses mindset from surviving to thriving?

This has been, by far, the busiest decade of my life both personally and professionally, and to see this company go from strength-to-strength in those years fills me with an immense amount of pride and gratitude - to my colleagues, employees, clients, candidates, peers and family who&rsquo;ve all helped in their own way to get us to where we are today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started AMsource Technology - as we were once known! - a decade ago, having just turned 30, yet to get married and with no kids. Ten years on, as a newly minted 40 year old, married and with two amazing daughters, it isn&rsquo;t just my personal circumstances that have changed and grown for the better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We started, as all fledgling recruitment businesses tend to, as a bums-on-seats transactionally focussed company, working with as many corporate clients as possible to generate revenue and grow the business in whatever way we could. While the service and expertise we offered was good and better than most, there wasn&rsquo;t anything revolutionary or special about who we were, what we did or how we went about doing it. Giving the business better focus and a more defined identity has been the real success of this first decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amsource is now a truly international company, working not just in our heartland of Leeds, but in Europe and America too, with a firm base set up in Berlin that&rsquo;s growing by the day. We&rsquo;ve moved away from some of our more corporate clients and work in the cutting edge start-up space, offering bespoke and innovative Edison and Talent Sauce product-lead talent solutions, rather than simply looking to make as many placements as possible. As our own knowledge and team has grown, so has our reputation and the advisory services we&rsquo;re able to offer, and I&rsquo;m proud that so many of our clients continue to work with us because of the relationships we&rsquo;ve formed, as well as the unicorn talent we help them identity and attract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our tenth year has thrown us its own challenges, but I&rsquo;m proud to have seen those through with the strongest team Amsource has ever assembled beside me. Having moved to bigger offices in a prime location in the centre of Leeds, we have the infrastructure in place to continue on the upwards trajectory we&rsquo;ve set ourselves on, with the ambition as strong now as it was on day one. The first ten years of running this business has been an incredible experience, affording me friends, memories and professional growth that I wouldn&rsquo;t have had otherwise, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where the next decade takes us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for all of your continued support, and I&rsquo;ll check back in when I&rsquo;m 50&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until then, Happy 10th Birthday Amsource!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Maeer,&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Founder &amp; CEO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Amsource Celebrates 10th Birthday', '', 'Amsource founder and CEO Andrew Maeer discussed a decade of being in business as Amsource', 'amsource-celebrates-10th-birthday', 'yes', 'no', 1593475200),

It&rsquo;s no secret that from March to May, that pulse was decidedly faint &ndash; but that is, thankfully, no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tech industry was far from being alone in erring on the side of caution, and while we navigated such unchartered waters, that was an entirely understandable mindset. Hiring wasn&rsquo;t completely frozen &ndash; companies that were already working in a fully remote capacity continued to attract talent &ndash; but for the most part, attention had shifted from creating jobs to retaining them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It now feels that, finally, the tide is beginning to turn. While the threat of Covid-19 remains a very real and present danger which should still be approached with complete caution and diligence, as an industry, tech has now settled in to working patterns that allows us to reengage with our ambition whilst adhering to the new public health guidelines. June provided the spark we were in desperate need of, and it was brilliant to see the collective enthusiasm return on the back of that taste of normality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a business, it marked our most successful June in the 10-year history of Amsource, which is a real signal of how positive the mindset within the market has become. Rewarded for the hard work we put in, we&nbsp;were&nbsp;proud to finish the month with a 100% fill rate across all of our vacancies, with a ratio of one hire for every two CVs we submitted. Matched with the partnership agreements in place to use our Edison Key Hire product, the full, efficient service we were able to provide our clients is something our team should be extremely proud of themselves for delivering, having received lots of positive feedback to further underline their performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carrying that momentum forward, we&rsquo;re still seeing those same levels of hunger within the market from the most exciting, ambitious businesses. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s still likely that many highly talented people will be let go in the near future as the furlough scheme experiences significant change &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t appear that they will remain on the market for very long, with many of our clients having already brought forward planned recruitment to provide new opportunities to those facing displacement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;re looking forward to helping the industry continue to flourish in the face of adversity, with the increased prevalence interviewing, onboarding and working remotely central to that success. If you are a candidate seeking a new opportunity or a business wanting to land the perfect person to expand your team, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to celebrate such positivity after what was a long and challenging time, and long may the industry and market remain this active and prosperous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David Robinson and Mike Dwyer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practice Lead, Amsource&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, 'Why June Was Such A Positive Month Within the Tech Industry', '', 'Looking at how the technology industry is recovering post Covid-19, and the market behaviour underlining that positivity', 'why-june-was-such-a-positive-month-within-the-tech-industry', 'yes', 'no', 1594339200),

A large proportion of our clients have their own recruitment resources internally, but know that without supplementary services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By allowing your internal recruitment department to work alongside Amsource, businesses open themselves up to not only better and more efficient results, but an additional knowledge bank and advisory resource. Our experience of the tech industry allows us to not only provide the best talent solutions and tools available on the market, but we can also discuss strategy and planning to help plot the best course to future success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happily, our reputation and contacts within the market allow us access to the best possible candidates in the industry, providing us the ability to place unicorn talent within your business at far shorter lead times than you would be able to achieve alone. As an additional dedicated resource, we can also help manage applications and interviews to ensure that you&rsquo;re only ever presented with the best possible options for your team, saving you time and energy that could be spent elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our approach is to work hand-in-hand with internal departments, and enhance the job they&rsquo;re able to do, rather than take their role away from them, or become a duplicate resource.

What was it about the Leeds Digital Festival Awards that initially made you want to get involved?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eve: I think the Awards are a really important opportunity to highlight some of the amazing businesses and individuals that we&rsquo;ve got in the Digital sector across the city and the region. We need to take a moment to celebrate and identify them because it provides a real boost to those individuals and organizations to be recognized in this way as well, and to receive acknowledgment of what they have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Do you think the main value of the Awards is to shine a spotlight on those businesses and individuals that deserve a bit of a boost? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: I think I would say that&rsquo;s the primary value, but there&rsquo;s also a secondary value &ndash; which is that it&rsquo;s a really fantastic way to show the rest of the North what we&rsquo;ve got here in Leeds and also to give those individuals a bit of a platform outside of the city. If they&rsquo;re in the process of growing their business and are looking to get more exposure for themselves, it can help trading. I think it&rsquo;s really helpful from that perspective as well so there&rsquo;s definitely two dimensions to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: With so many big tech businesses in the city, tech is quite a large part of the local economy now isn&rsquo;t it? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes the tech sector is really important to Leeds. As a council we&rsquo;ve done a lot of work to support the digital sector over the past 4/5 years in particular, and what I would say is that this is even more important now than it was before Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The digital sector has probably been impacted much less than the rest of the economy and in fact has probably been presented with quite a lot of opportunities. I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s not entirely universal but compared to other sectors, the digital sector is definitely getting through this much stronger and I can see how there&rsquo;s lots of opportunities for the digital sector coming forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we&rsquo;ve seen across the broader economy is sectors like manufacturing adopting digital technologies that they haven&rsquo;t done before because they&rsquo;ve had to innovate, and I think that presents great opportunities for some of our entrepreneurs and our businesses of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: You mentioned then that over the past 4/5 years the council have done more to support tech as a sector, what exactly have those initiatives been?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: So we do a range of things. We&rsquo;ve been sponsors of the Leeds Digital Festival since it started and we&rsquo;re really proud to support the Digital Festival and see how that&rsquo;s grown over the years. We think that the Digital Festival alone has been an incredible success for the city in terms of helping amplify what&rsquo;s already going on in the city and it&rsquo;s a fabulous collaborative event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But we&rsquo;ve also invested in supporting networks like FinTech North. Also, before FinTech North came about, we helped with the mapping of FinTech. We&rsquo;ve worked with a number of partners to get a similar initiative off the ground on Legal Tech which is underway at the moment.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve also provided support to North Invest as they&rsquo;ve got going, in terms of providing access to more funding for entrepreneurs in the digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it&rsquo;s a whole range of things really. We do tend to support some of the networks promoting diversity in tech like empowering women in tech and the women of Leeds Digital as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Is one of the advantages perhaps that the council maybe looking to show prospective businesses that might be looking at Leeds to come and base themselves that this is a place that has a thriving tech community as well? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes absolutely. The piece of work we&rsquo;re doing at the moment on FinTech mapping and the work we&rsquo;re now doing on Legal Tech is absolutely about that. It has multiple aims of bringing together stakeholders across the city to make sure that they understand just how fantastic the assets are that we have collectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It also provides a way to present to prospective inward investors this is a great place to bring your business. The announcement that Iwoca made about opening their second office in Leeds that was informed by information that we were able to provide as a consequence of that FinTech mapping to show the collective potential of Leeds as a destination for that business. So absolutely there is an inward investment angle to some of the work we do as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: In your opinion, why should people submit nominations for the Leeds Digital Festival Awards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: I think it&rsquo;s a great way to put forward an individual or organization that you think do brilliant things and to give them a boost. Particularly now businesses have just gone through a patch of Covid-19 response where someone has been working incredibly hard or a business has really shone through in terms of how they&rsquo;ve pivoted in response to Covid-19 and they&rsquo;re a kind of upcoming business in the city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: Do you think given the ongoing success in tech in the face of adversity is enough reason to hold the Awards? and underline that we still have things to celebrate and be positive about despite the challenges of this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: Yes absolutely I would agree with that, and there is much for us to feel optimistic about in the city. This is a great way of us showcasing some of the areas where we can still do a lot together as a region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are going to have our challenges in terms of the economy, but I think the tech and digital sector has a big role to play in terms of the momentum that the sector has, and how the sector can play it&rsquo;s role in supporting the city and the region during this recovery. This is a brilliant way to build further momentum and show where those stars are in our tech and digital sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: As a Leeds Digital Festival Awards judge, what do you look out for? What&rsquo;s in your judging criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: What will I be looking out for? I think I&rsquo;ll be looking out for good ideas, so I like to see business that have got really good products and services that are great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&rsquo;ll also be looking out for leadership and how people are either leading the way in terms of their business or individually, and showing how we can have really forward thinking businesses. I like to look at how businesses operate, whether that&rsquo;s around addressing diversity &ndash; either diversity of thought or diversity of talent. I also like to ask how are some of these businesses collaborating with one another to really make a difference and drive forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A: That was a really good catch up, thank you again for taking the time to speak to us! &nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E: It was my pleasure, and thank you Amsource for sponsoring the Awards!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The rescheduled Leeds Digital Festival Awards will now be held on the 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September, with the final format yet to be confirmed.

Our aim is to be seen as industry leaders in the Leeds tech scene, and winning the award has definitely helped to boost that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about the Leeds City Region tech sector do you think deserves celebration?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, we have seen significant commercial investment within the Leeds City Region. It is fantastic that Developers and other organisations recognise Leeds as being a hub for investment. Numerous organisations have now confirmed that they will be solely based in Leeds, such as Channel 4, HMRC, and SkyBet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has your business been throughout the Covid-19 pandemic?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As an organisation that solely runs on SAAS Technology, we were able to seamlessly transition to a remote working model early on in March. We recognised that it is important for us to contribute to the Leeds tech community by taking advantage of this ease of transition so that we could put less pressure on the local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a Google Cloud Premier Partner, we have been following a &ldquo;Serve Not Sell&rdquo; mantra. We have been helping our customers transition to this new remote way of working and Support accordingly during their transition. Moving forwards, we are working with new organisations to ascertain areas within their business where Google Technology can help improve efficiencies, cost optimisations and aid with supporting the new normal we find ourselves in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do you think your business stood out to our judging panel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since Netpremacy moved from number 2 to 6 Wellington Place, I believe this has acted as a catalyst to enable us to have the capacity to accelerate our business and as a result, obtain significant Year on Year growth. The fundamentals of our key principles are based upon the following: Do the right thing, take responsibility, be transparent, continuously improve and take pride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This viewpoint has enabled us to build strategic partnerships with some of the most well established and recognised brands in the UK, giving us the platform to build an incredible team around it. I truly believe our agile, dynamic culture has attracted some of the best talents in Leeds and that we will have a fascinating future as the Cloud Technology market continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the goals of the business over the next year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We will continue to follow our 5 key principles as described above. Due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in, we have a duty to support our customers during a time where things are constantly changing. We also have a responsibility to look after our people and ensure that we have the best practices in place as a business to provide a safe working environment and also to give people the flexibility to work in a manner that makes them feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growth remains a key component of our business - we continue to employ and have recently expanded our commercial team further. This shows a desire to keep growing and continue along our journey with Google Cloud. Our approach will be focused around aiding organisations to leverage Google Cloud Technology to remain competitive within their industry and use Cloud as a differentiating factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We recognise a lot of organisations will be focused on cost savings, efficiency improvements, and having the right technology in place to support a flexible way of working. We strongly believe Google Cloud will aid this significantly and will put all our efforts into aiding this and building further Partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;NOMINATIONS FOR THE 2020 LEEDS DIGITAL FESTIVAL AWARDS CLOSE THIS FRIDAY 7th&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;AUGUST.

(88, 'Amsource release Remote Onboarding Blueprint', 0, '', '', '22c77b21753240cceacce1adb7f30bf1.png', '&lt;p&gt;During our first webinar on remote working, one topic that was frequently raised as an area of confusion was remote onboarding. With tech businesses still looking to fulfil projects, grow teams and remain ambitious, the process of onboarding new starters of all levels quickly became a task that presented difficulties &ndash; not only logistically, but practically and holistically, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How can that human interaction be replicated to maintain that same welcoming atmosphere and informative nature without becoming alienating or impersonal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, and knowing there was a huge appetite for discussion around the theme of onboarding remotely, we organised an online masterclass with a panel of experts, allowing them to share their knowledge and experience with those hoping to learn and adapt in their own roles, giving the tech community a platform through which to share and collaborate in the hope that the sector as a whole can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With speakers from across the European tech scene, we brought together Irena Yeung from SolarisBank, Alasdair Thompson from BAE Systems, Matjaz Domen Pecan from Spark Networks and Anjo Gaul, who had been the Community Manager at TestIO. Collectively, the assembled panel had either been onboarding remotely &ndash; and successfully &ndash; before the COVID-19 pandemic had hit, or had quickly adopted their operations during lockdown to accommodate the changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The full session is &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/hsgec8oeEA0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for those who missed it live or wish to re-watch, but we also worked alongside our panel to create a Remote Onboarding Blueprint, which we&rsquo;ve designed to help those recruiting within the tech sector maintain best practice, and have a constant reminder and reference point for all of the many factors that need to be considered when a new starter is joining in the current climate. Broken down in to twenty digestible segments to allow the user to create their own process from the information presented, it&rsquo;s a tool we&rsquo;ve already received great feedback from, as we wanted to ensure its usefulness before sharing widely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was just the second session in a three-part remote working webinar series, with the third and final part of that series a collaboration with MURAL focussed on remote culture and collaboration &ndash; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/remote-culture-and-collaboration-with-mural-webinar-tickets-115958036609&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you can find out more about that event here&lt;/a&gt;.

However, working from home is different during a pandemic because there&#039;s an additional layer of stress and isolation that is much more intense than usual. Pre COVID-19, I was free to work in other locations like coworking spaces or a friend&#039;s house. Now it&#039;s clearly not the case and that lack of choice can feel suffocating at times, even for those who are used to working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important do you believe the culture and collaboration component of remote working to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s really key to have culture and collaboration top of mind in any company, but especially more so for distributed teams because this will affect how people communicate, how teams align and ultimately how connected teammates feel despite the geographical distances that separate them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s even more complex in hybrid companies that have both offices and remote team members because there&#039;s a mix of practices from a traditional office culture and remote culture. With time, we can build in new habits and rituals that can overlap and satisfy the needs of both, but it takes a lot of trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you hoping that our webinar attendees will take away from your presentation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve heard a lot of complaints about working from home in the past months, understandably when it&#039;s been forced onto companies in our current global context. I hope that participants will understand that it takes time to adapt to new ways of working and collaborative processes, and won&#039;t give up due to initial hardships.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If somebody was thinking of coming to the webinar but not completely sold on the idea, what would you say to persuade them it was a worthwhile use of their time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Culture is fundamental for any company. The fact that people don&#039;t give it enough attention is what causes a lot of issues at work. Be one of those people who actually give a damn so you can help your workplace be better! I bet you&#039;ll learn at least ONE new thing you can take away with you and apply in your teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/remote-culture-and-collaboration-with-mural-webinar-tickets-115958036609&quot; style=&quot;color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE: join Amsource and MURAL at our Remote Culture and Collaboration webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', '', '', 'amsource-to-host-remote-culture-and-collaboration-webinar-with-mural', 'yes', 'no', 1597795200),

Having that inside line on what both candidates want and aspire to, as well as knowing what hiring managers and companies actually value and look for in new recruits gives me a complete view on how to build a career in this space.&nbsp;This allows me the chance to speak to both sides of that particular dynamic and offer insight and advice that they wouldn&rsquo;t usually hear, hopefully allowing businesses a greater understanding of how to be better employers, and candidates&nbsp;a better chance of presenting themselves in a way that best highlights their talent.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, one recent mentee had moved from the United States to Berlin with his partner but&nbsp;was really struggling to find work&nbsp;despite filing almost 100 applications for a front-end role. Having helped tweak his CV and application answers, as well as providing interview techniques and showing him in the areas in which he should be more engaged in the community,&nbsp;he found himself in the position of having three separate firm offers from which to choose.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With fourteen years of experience, I have helped countless people accelerate their careers and have been at the centre of the team building process for countless other companies &ndash; that leaves me perfectly places to speak to anyone looking for advice on how to take the next steps in their career, or provide insight to hiring managers who want to attract the best talent possible, but aren&rsquo;t sure how.&nbsp;Not just my career, the tech industry is a real passion of mine outside of office hours, and while I may not use the technologies I recruit for as&nbsp;an engineer, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped me from keeping up with all of the latest industry trends and&nbsp;developments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the current climate how it is, with so many talented people out of work and tech companies still eager to fulfil projects under strained circumstances, I&rsquo;d love to help in any way I can to get our industry on the path to thriving again &ndash; and the Mentoring Club seems like an excellent platform through which to connect to the people who might want to speak the most&nbsp;and benefit from sharing my experience.

By being overly wedded to the idea of CVs, businesses can actually delay the hiring process and cut themselves off from the type of talent that could really boost their company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That isn&rsquo;t to say, of course, that CVs have no role to play anymore. For those either out of work or actively seeking new opportunities, few things state an intention better than a CV being submitted &ndash; however, they are now only one factor that can be considered, and definitely not the only documentation that is helpful or capable of underlining career achievements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often, supplementary work such as GitHub links, LinkedIn profiles, Medium posts, Slack communities and personal portfolio sites can hold as much water as a CV would, especially where examples of work or passion projects can be evidenced and highlighted in a meaningful sense. For backend developers, publishing examples of code gives potential employers an opportunity to see a practical example of your work in practice, while UX designers and front-end developers can &lsquo;wow&rsquo; with their creativity and originality by marketing themselves with original work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most often, it is a blend of all of the above that lands the perfect candidate within their dream role, and marries ambitious businesses with their ideal hire. In this day and age, a CV alone just doesn&rsquo;t cut it like it used to, and that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing &ndash; candidates have much better ways to highlight their own talent, and employees have a greater depth of material through which to judge potential additions. The faster we accept and embrace that new reality, the smoother the recruitment experience in tech will become.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you a business looking to hire unicorn talent, or a candidate seeking a new opportunity but unsure of how to best position your experience?

(92, 'Automation, adaptability and acceleration: Rebuilding the technology sector post-COVID', 2, '', '', '5d5b06b67b8048da65ff3a24b42eda63.png', '&lt;p&gt;No industry was left untouched by the pandemic. Its suffocating presence forced us all to swim for our lives or risk sinking faster than we could have ever imagined. However, as Europe&rsquo;s &ndash; and the world&rsquo;s &ndash; economies begin their journeys on the road to recovery, digitisation will invariably be a key driver in stimulating growth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, what is equally clear to see is that those businesses who were slow to adopt or placed themselves in containment mode until the proverbial storm has passed are already showing signs of falling far behind those who were quick to jump on the opportunities that lockdown provided.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While an industry damaged by the ramifications of COVID-19, the technology sector&rsquo;s broad scope for realignment and innovation has never been greater and the businesses that have, and still are, seizing opportunity by the horns are now reaping the rewards almost six months on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, what does the future look like for the tech sector?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: Flexible working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The survivors of the pandemic are those that moved and flexed with every sharp peak and trough, the leaders that listened to feedback and implemented change, teams that banded together as a unit of strength and businesses that weren&rsquo;t afraid to accept the &lsquo;new normal&rsquo;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with many other industries, flexible working was one of the first changes to enter the tech sector with force. Research by Amsource found that only a few months into lockdown, three quarters of businesses had changed their working patterns as a direct consequence of coronavirus, with only 5 per cent of respondents saying that having people working from home had a detrimental effect on company culture.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic, remote working will not only open up a much wider, more active talent pool which isn&rsquo;t restricted by location, but it will also be a driving factor for many entry-level employees who now consider flexible working patterns or remote working to be a necessary employee offering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: Filling the skills gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The past 12 months has seen a strong demand from CIOs for software developers, and this trend isn&rsquo;t going to slow down post-COVID. This is partly because of the innovation and investment which many companies put into their software development initiatives during lockdown, as well as a foresight from many tech leaders who predict an upcoming shortfall in talent as COVID-19 restrictive measures are lifted further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, the skills needed from candidates will shift away from the pre-pandemic norm with softer skills, such as emotional intelligence and collaboration, needing to be equally balanced with harder skills, such as UX and cloud knowledge. Whilst experience is still key, those more human-focused skills will be the determining factor for longer-term employee retention, with leaders wanting to find more dynamic candidates who fit the company&rsquo;s culture and ethos without any damaging friction.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation: The creation of more tech roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;HR and tech, two traditionally very separate areas of the workplace are now kindling a new, much closer relationship post-COVID, both aligning to see how and where AI and automation could help HR efforts in tasks such as administration and assembly-line production.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While automation is not as new as the hype would have you believe, its potential has never shone brighter than it does now, with a striking number of roles predicted to be created through the technology in the coming years.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, speaking to ITPro magazine, I was keen to emphasize this very point. I told the reporter: &ldquo;The automation of labour is not a new phenomenon despite the hype, but what is striking is the sheer number of new roles that are likely to be created in the coming years.&rdquo; (read full article here). Research from Forrester points to an estimated 15 million new jobs entering the technology market over the coming decade as a direct result of automation and AI.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before we become very dystopian about it all, we need to try and dismiss the thoughts that robots are coming to take over our jobs. Instead, jobs will be created by technology and existing roles will change for the better.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceleration: It&rsquo;s time to up the ante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, we&rsquo;re seeing a rise in the number of job vacancies in the sector and while in normal times this might be a worry for the industry, it is in fact an extremely positive sign. Companies are realising that it is time to move quickly and recover lost ground from months of uncertainty in order to retain market share - it&rsquo;s time to build back those teams and fast.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only will companies need to work hard to refill traditional roles, but now is the time to look forward and begin planning for those roles that will undoubtedly be born out of the COVID-19 crisis that perhaps haven&rsquo;t been defined yet but will be profound for the future of tech.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any time of severe distress drives innovation and brings about change, and the current crisis will be no different. The last two years has seen technology advance at a speed and scale never seen before, and this will unquestionably be accelerated even further as will the range of new roles entering the tech space.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', '', 10, '', 'Automation Adaptability Acceleration Rebuilding Post-COVID', '', 'automation-adaptability-and-acceleration-rebuilding-the-technology-sector-post-covid', 'yes', 'no', 1598918400),
